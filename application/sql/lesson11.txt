Lesson 11 Words compiled by Michael Huynh

æ¸¸ [yÃ³u] (æ¸¸æ³³ yÃ³uyÇ’ng) swim; (æ—…æ¸¸ lÇšyÃ³u) travel
From æ°µ(æ°´ shuÇ) 'water', î¿ˆ (yÇn) 'banner', and å­ (zÇ 'child').
	The î¿ˆ waving motions of a å­ swimmer -- not necessarily a child: the legs are invisible under water; compare æµ® fÃº 'float'.
	Variant forms are æ–¿ (without æ°µ, formerly used for the meaning 'ribbon on top of a banner'), and éŠ (with è¾¶(è¾µ chuÃ²) 'go' in place of æ°µ(æ°´ shuÇ) 'water', sometimes used for the meaning 'travel').

è§ˆ(Fè¦½) [lÇn] å±•è§ˆ zhÇnlÇn exhibition; æ¸¸è§ˆ yÃ³ulÇn go sightseeing
The top î¿¤ is from ç›‘(ç›£) jiÄn (prison, supervise) phonetic. The bottom is è§(è¦‹ jiÃ n) 'see'.
	Compare è“ lÃ¡n etc.

è®¸(Fè¨±) [xÇ”] allow; è®¸å¤š xÇ”duÅ a lot; ä¹Ÿè®¸ yÄ›xÇ” perhaps  [hÇ”]
From è® (è¨€ yÃ¡n) 'words' (permission) and åˆ wÇ” (noon) phonetic.

èƒœ(Få‹) [shÃ¨ng] (èƒœåˆ© shÃ¨nglÃ¬) victory, triumph, win
The simple form èƒœ is æœˆ plus ç”Ÿ shÄ“ng phonetic.
	The full form å‹ is composed of æœ• zhÃ¨n phonetic, and åŠ› (lÃ¬) 'strength' (the similarity to åˆ¸ quÃ n is accidental). The left side was originally èˆŸ zhÅu 'boat', not æœˆ yuÃ¨ 'moon' or è‚‰ rÃ²u 'meat'.

è¿¹(Fè·¡) [jÃ¬] (ç—•è¿¹ hÃ©njÃ¬) mark, trace, vestige; å¥‡è¿¹ qÃ­jÃ¬ miracle
From äº¦ yÃ¬ (also) phonetic and è¾¶(è¾µ chuÃ²) 'go' or â»Š(è¶³ zÃº) 'foot'.
	"Footprint, track; trace, vestige; to track, examine; follow in the wake of" --Karlgren(1923).
	Formerly the standard pronunciation of è¿¹ was jÄ«, but it was officially changed to jÃ¬ in 1985 (æ™®é€šè¯å¼‚è¯»è¯å®¡éŸ³è¡¨), presumably to reflect actual common usage.

æ•… [gÃ¹] cause; therefore; æ•…äº‹ gÃ¹shi story; æ•…æ„ gÃ¹yÃ¬ on purpose
From å¤ gÇ” phonetic and æ”µ(æ”´ pÅ«) 'beat'.

æŒ¤(Fæ“ ) [jÇ] squeeze; crowd; push, jostle; æ‹¥æŒ¤ yÅngjÇ crowded
From æ‰Œ(æ‰‹ shÇ’u) 'hand' and é½(é½Š) qÃ­ (neat together) phonetic.

åº¦ [dÃ¹] degree, extent; åˆ¶åº¦ system   [duÃ³] çŒœåº¦ cÄiduÃ³ surmise
From å¹¿ (guÇng) 'house', å»¿ (niÃ n) 'twenty', and åˆ (yÃ²u) 'hand'.
	"To have åˆ in one's hand å»¿ (twenty:) all the inhabitants of å¹¿ the house: rule, regulate, cf. åº¶ and å¦¥" --Karlgren.
	Don't confuse åº¦ dÃ¹ with å¸­ xÃ­ 'seat'.

ç­‘(Fç¯‰) [zhÃ¹] build, construct; å»ºç­‘å­¦ architecture  [ZhÃº]
From ç«¹ zhÃº phonetic and å·© (gÇ’ng) 'consolidate'.
	The full form ç¯‰ has æœ¨ (mÃ¹) 'wood' at the bottom.

æ ¼ [gÃ©] check, pattern, standard; æ ¼å¤– gÃ©wÃ i especially  [gÄ“]
From æœ¨ (mÃ¹) 'wood' and å„ gÃ¨ phonetic. æœ¨ might convey the idea of carpentry, hence 'pattern'.

çª„ [zhÇi] narrow
From ç©´ (xuÃ©) 'hole' and ä¹ zhÃ  ('suddenly') phonetic.
	Since ä¹ represents å…¥ going into a í¡€í³Š corner but being ä¸€ obstructed, it also suggests the meaning 'narrow'.

å¦™ [miÃ o] wonderful; subtle; è«åå…¶å¦™
From å¥³ (nÇš) 'woman' and å°‘ (shÇo) 'few'.
	"å°‘ small å¥³ woman" --Karlgren.
	Etymologically related to æª miÇo 'tiny', and ç§’ miÇo 'second' etc.

é¾„(Fé½¡) [lÃ­ng] (å¹´é¾„) age; duration
From é½¿(é½’ chÇ) 'tooth' and ä»¤ lÃ­ng phonetic.
	Formerly meant "front teeth"; perhaps animals' growth was measured by the length of their teeth?

ç  [zhÅ«] (ç å­ zhÅ«zi) pearl; bead; çœ¼ç å­ eyeball; æ³ªç  teardrop
From ç‹(ç‰ yÃ¹) 'jade' and æœ± zhÅ« phonetic.

ç‹  [hÄ›n] ruthless
From çŠ­(çŠ¬ quÇn) 'dog' and è‰® gÃ¨n.

çª [dÃ¨ng] open (one's eyes) wide, stare, glare; çªçœ¼
From ç›® (mÃ¹) 'eye' and ç™» dÄ“ng phonetic.
	Compare ç(çœ) zhÄ“ng 'open the eyes' and ç›¯ dÄ«ng 'stare at'.

æ¹– [hÃº] lake; æ¹–æ³Š hÃºpÅ lakes; æ¹–å— Hunan; æ¹–åŒ— Hubei
From æ°µ(æ°´ shuÇ) 'water' and èƒ¡ hÃº (recklessly, beard) phonetic.

åˆ’ [huÃ¡] row (a boat) (FåŠƒ) scratch [huÃ ] (FåŠƒ) (è®¡åˆ’ jÃ¬huÃ ) plan (Fç•«)
From æˆˆ gÄ“ phonetic and åˆ‚(åˆ€ dÄo) 'knife'.
	"To pole a boat" --Karlgren.
	The pronunciation huÃ , with the falling tone, is really a different word; among full form characters it is written åŠƒ, from ç•« huÃ  'draw' and åˆ‚(åˆ€ dÄo) 'knife'. In fact åŠƒ huÃ  is etymologically the same word as ç•« huÃ .
	"Delimit, mark off; split" --Karlgren.
	To further complicate matters, among full form characters some words can be written with either åŠƒ or ç•«: for example, è¨ˆåŠƒ or è¨ˆç•« jÃ¬huÃ  'plan'. But among simple form characters, only è®¡åˆ’ is standard (not *è®¡ç”»).
	Among simple form characters, åˆ’ is used for both huÃ¡ and huÃ .

å¢™(Fç‰†) [qiÃ¡ng] (å¢™å£ qiÃ¡ngbÃ¬) wall
The right side is å•¬(å—‡ sÃ¨) 'to store; miserly', depicting å› double walls for ä¾† grain.
	The left side is çˆ¿ qiÃ¡ng phonetic in the full form ç‰†, or åœŸ (tÇ”) 'earth' in the variant form å¢» and the simple form å¢™.
	Compare è”·å«±æ¨¯ qiÃ¡ng.

å° [yÃ¬n] (å°åˆ· yÃ¬nshuÄ) print; (å°ç«  yÃ¬nzhÄng) seal
The left side is from çˆ«(çˆª zhÇo) a hand, turned sideways. The right side is å© (jiÃ©) a person kneeling. The hand is pushing the person down. The original meaning was 'press down, restrain', modern æŠ‘ yÃ¬.
	(The traditional explanation is that å© represents a seal, and çˆ« is a hand using the seal).

è±¡ [xiÃ ng] appearance; (å¤§è±¡ dÃ xiÃ ng) elephant
Picture of an elephant.
	"Elephant; ivory; figure cut in ivory, figure, image, form; similar, to resemble; comparison, symbol, model" --Karlgren.
	åƒ xiÃ ng 'image' is etymologically the same word.

æ·± [shÄ“n] deep; æ·±åˆ» shÄ“nkÃ¨ profound; æ·±å¤œ shÄ“nyÃ¨ late at night
Deep æ°µ(æ°´ shuÇ) water, deep ç©´ (xuÄ›) hole, and deep æœ¨ (mÃ¹) forest. ç©´ is missing the dot on top. Really the right side ç½™ was from ç©´ pit, î¿° hand and ç« (huÇ’) fire. The î¿° hand and ç« torch mutated into æœ¨ mÃ¹.
	The earlier form ç½™ without æ°µ is co-signific in æ¢ tÃ n ("put hand into deep pit"). See also ç› chÄ“n where ç½™ is phonetic.

é™µ [lÃ­ng] hill, mound; tomb; åä¸‰é™µ the 13 Ming tombs
Originally written å¤Œ, from åœ¥ (lÃ¹) 'mound' over å¤‚ (zhÇ) 'walk slowly'.
	"From å¤‚ walk with difficulty and å´ mound abbreviated" --Karlgren(1923).
	é˜(é˜œ fÃ¹) 'hill' was added later.
	Don't confuse é™µ lÃ­ng with é™†(é™¸) lÃ¹ 'land'.

å¹• [mÃ¹] curtain; act (of play); å±å¹• pÃ­ngmÃ¹ screen
From è« mÃ² phonetic and å·¾ (jÄ«n) 'cloth'.

å£®(Få£¯) [zhuÃ ng] robust, magnificent; å£®ä¸½ majestic; å£®æ—
From ä¸¬(çˆ¿) qiÃ¡ng and å£« (shÃ¬) 'officer'.
	Compare çŠ¶(ç‹€) zhuÃ ng 'condition' and èŠ(åº„) zhuÄng 'village'.

è§‚(Fè§€) [guÄn] view; ï€¼ Contemplation    [guÃ n] é“è§‚ temple
The full form è§€ is composed of é›š guÃ n phonetic and è¦‹(è§) jiÃ n 'see'. In the simple form è§‚, é›š is abbreviated to åˆ, just as in æ¬¢(æ­¡) huÄn 'happy'.

"å›— wall and î¿© roof (cf åˆ) made of å±® straw; the similarity with èˆŒ in the modern form is fortuitous" --Karlgren.
	The component å±® is reduced to å in the modern character, just above å›—. The lower part is not quite the same as èˆŒ shÃ©: the top stroke is ä¸€ not ä¸¿.

çª [tÅ«] charge forward; stick out; çªç„¶ tÅ«rÃ¡n suddenly
From ç©´ (xuÃ©) 'hole' over çŠ¬ (quÇn) 'dog'.
	A çŠ¬ dog suddenly charging into a ç©´ hole, to catch a rabbit. Since the dog can't fit all the way into the rabbit hole, its tail sticks out.

è‘¬ [zÃ ng] (åŸ‹è‘¬ mÃ¡izÃ ng) bury (the dead); è‘¬ç¤¼ funeral
From è‰¹(è‰ cÇo) 'herbs' (top and bottom) and æ­» (sÇ) 'death'.
	"To bury; to hide -- to cover a æ­» dead person's body with è‰¸ herbs (doubled: the lower è‰¸ now deformed into å»¾); the word is cognate to è— to hide" --Karlgren.

ç¢‘ [bÄ“i] upright stone tablet (monument, etc); å¢“ç¢‘ tombstone
From çŸ³ (shÃ­) 'stone' and å‘ bÄ“i ('vulgar') phonetic.

åª³ [xÃ­] åª³å¦‡ xÃ­fÃ¹ daughter-in-law; ç«¥å…»åª³ tÃ³ngyÇngxÃ­ child bride

æ•¬ [jÃ¬ng] (å°Šæ•¬ zÅ«njÃ¬ng) respect
The modern form is è‹Ÿ plus æ”µ 'beat'.
	The left side originally derives from a slightly different character èŒ jÃ¬, one of whose meanings is 'respectful':
