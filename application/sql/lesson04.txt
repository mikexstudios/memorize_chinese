Lesson 4 Words compiled by Michael Huynh

æ¤ [xÃ¹] pity, sympathize; give relief
From å¿„(å¿ƒ xÄ«n) 'heart' and è¡€ xuÃ¨ ('blood') phonetic.

ä»” â´zÇi b.f. â‘ son â‘¡youth (male) â‘¢young of animals
From äº»(äºº rÃ©n) 'person' and å­ zÇ 'child'.

è£¤(Fè¤²) [kÃ¹] (è£¤å­) pants
From è¡¤(è¡£ yÄ«) 'clothing' and åº“(åº«) kÃ¹ (warehouse) phonetic.

ç­‰ [dÄ›ng] equal; class; wait; et cetera (etc.)
From ç«¹ (zhÃº) 'bamboo' and å¯º sÃ¬ 'temple'.
	ç«¹ probably stands for ç«¹ç®€ zhÃºjiÇn, the bamboo strips which were used for writing on before the invention of paper. Hence, record keeping, order, classification; (belonging to the same class:) equal.
	å¯º sÃ¬ 'temple' is part of ç­‰ dÄ›ng due to an etymological accident. An ancient word sounded similar to å¯º sÃ¬, so it was written ç­‰, with ç«¹ signific and å¯º phonetic. That word disappeared, and the character ç­‰ was borrowed to represent a synonym, now pronounced dÄ›ng.

æ— (Fç„¡) [wÃº] without; nothingness  [mÃ³] å—æ— 
Picture of a dancer with fancy sleeves or tassels in his or her hands. Now 'dance' is èˆ wÇ”, with èˆ› two feet added to the bottom. ç„¡ was borrowed for the word wÃº 'without'. The simple form æ—  has co-existed with ç„¡ for thousands of years; æ—  is apparently just a simpler depiction of the same dancer.

è®º(Fè«–) [lÃ¹n] theory   [LÃºn] è®ºè¯­ LÃºnyÇ” Analects of Confucius
From è® (è¨€ yÃ¡n) 'words' and ä»‘(ä¾–) lÃºn (logical consequence) phonetic.

ç‰Œ [pÃ¡i] tablet; brand; cards; dominoes: ç‰Œå­ sign
From ç‰‡ (piÃ n) 'slice' and å‘ bÄ“i (base, vulgar) phonetic.

éœ€ [xÅ«] (éœ€è¦ xÅ«yÃ o) need; ï€…; å¿…éœ€ bÃ¬xÅ« essential
From é›¨ yÇ” ('rain') phonetic and è€Œ (Ã©r) which depicts a beard.
	It's easy to confuse éœ€ xÅ« 'need' with é¡» xÅ« 'must' (as in å¿…é¡» bÃ¬xÅ«). They are etymologically the same word, according to Karlgren(1923). To be precise, éœ€ and é¡» are both used to write xÅ« 'need/must', but in different compounds; they are generally not interchangeable. Karlgren says éœ€ probably was originally used for the word é¡»(é¬š) xÅ« 'beard' (as in èƒ¡é¡» hÃºxÅ«), which explains why it contains è€Œ.

ç²‰ [fÄ›n] powder; æ´—è¡£ç²‰ laundry detergent; ç²‰çº¢è‰² pink
From ç±³ (mÇ) 'rice' and åˆ† fÄ“n ('divide') phonetic.

è† [gÄo] ç‰™è† yÃ¡gÄo toothpaste; æ²¹è† ointment  [gÃ o] lubricate
From é«˜ gÄo and æœˆ(è‚‰ rÃ²u) 'flesh'.

çš‚ [zÃ o] è‚¥çš‚ fÃ©izÃ o soap
"Herbs used for black-dyeing; black; (black-clothed:) servant, lictor, yamen-runner -- same character [as è‰ cÇo] more or less deformed" --Karlgren.
	The bottom is ä¸ƒ (qÄ«), not åŒ• or í¡‚í´. A variant form is çš. Compare çš€ (pot of food).

å«(Fè¡›) [wÃ¨i] ä¿å« defend; å«ç”Ÿ sanitary; å«æ˜Ÿ satellite
The full form è¡› is éŸ‹ wÃ©i (soft, leather) phonetic inside of è¡Œ (xÃ­ng) 'walk'.
	Cognate with å›´(åœ) wÃ©i 'surround', but å«(è¡›) wÃ¨i is pronounced with the falling tone.

å·¾ [jÄ«n] piece of cloth; æ¯›å·¾ towel; é¤å·¾ napkin; å›´å·¾ scarf
Picture of a handkerchief hanging from a girdle.
	å·¾ is the 50th of the 214 KÄngxÄ« radicals, occuring as a signific component in å¸ƒ bÃ¹ 'cloth', å¸¦ dÃ i 'belt', å¸½ mÃ o 'hat', etc.

äº [yÃº] (surname); (Fæ–¼) in, at, to, from, by, than
The vertical stroke is äº…, with a hook on the bottom; compare å¹² gÄn which doesn't have a hook. The form äº is "said to be a symbol of an exclamation, analogous to ä¸‚ qiÇo and ä¹ hÅ«, cf. also æ°” qÃ¬" --Karlgren.
	Formerly äº was sometimes written äº (lose money), but äº is now used as the simple form of äº(è™§) kuÄ«.
	There is another character, æ–¼ yÃº, which is sometimes used in place of äº yÃº among full form characters. æ–¼ is still in use among simple form characters for the surname æ–¼ YÅ«.

åŒ– [huÃ ] (å˜åŒ– biÃ nhuÃ ) change  [huÄ] (=èŠ±) spend
åŒ– huÃ  depicts a person and a person upside-down. The left side is äº»(äºº rÃ©n) 'person'. The right side í¡‚í´ was originally äºº upside-down. A person who flips, changes.

å¦†(Få¦) [zhuÄng] adorn oneself; å¦†å¥ bride's trousseau
From ä¸¬(çˆ¿) (piece of wood) qiÃ¡ng phonetic and å¥³ (nÇš) 'woman'.

è´­(Fè³¼) [gÃ²u] (è´­ä¹° gÃ²umÇi) purchase
From è´(è² bÃ¨i) 'money' and (full form:) å†“ gÃ²u or (simple form:) å‹¾ (cross out, group, gang up, deal) gÃ²u phonetic.

ç‰© [wÃ¹] thing; åŠ¨ç‰© animal; æ¤ç‰© plant; ç‰©ç† physics
From ç‰› (niÃº) 'ox' and å‹¿ wÃ¹ (do not) phonetic.

å¥— [tÃ o] set; cover; æ‰‹å¥— glove; ä¸€å¥—è¡£æœ a suit
From å¤§ (dÃ ) 'big' and é•¸(é•¿ chÃ¡ng) 'long'.
	"Assortment; put in an envelope; an envelope, case, covering -- to assort according to å¤§ (greatness:) size and é•· length" --Karlgren.

çŸ­ [duÇn] short (opposite of é•¿ chÃ¡ng)
From çŸ¢ (shÇ) 'arrow' and è±† (dÃ²u) 'bean'. è±† meant 'sacrificial vessel' before it meant 'bean'.
	 "çŸ¢ arrows used in è±† sacrificial rites, shorter than real arrows?" --Karlgren.

åš [hÃ²u] thick; deep; kind; rich (food)   (cf è–„ bÃ¡o thin)
The modern character is composed of å‚ (chÇng) over æ—¥ (rÃ¬) over å­ (zÃ¬). The inside part formerly looked like äº« (xiÇng) (enjoy) upside-down, but the explanation is unclear.

è–„ [bÃ¡o] thin  [bÃ³] slight; è–„å¼± weak  [bÃ²] è–„è· peppermint
From è‰¹(è‰ cÇo) 'grass' and æº¥ pÇ” (broad, vast, common) phonetic.

å‡(Fæ¸›) [jiÇn] subtract; å‡å°‘ jiÇnshÇo decrease
From å†« or æ°µ(æ°´ shuÇ) 'water' and å’¸ xiÃ¡n (all, salty) phonetic.

ä»· [jiÃ ] (Fåƒ¹) (ä»·å€¼) value; (ä»·é’±) price  [jie] (Fåƒ¹)  [jiÃ¨] servant
From äº»(äºº rÃ©n) 'person' and (full form:) è³ˆ JiÇ or (simple form:) ä»‹ jiÃ¨ (introduce) phonetic.
	Coincidentally, there was an old character written ä»· meaning 'servant', see Karlgren 360 and the expression è°´ä»· (send servant on errand).

æŠ˜ [zhÃ©] fold; break; change direction [shÃ©] break [zhÄ“] turn over
From æ‰Œ(æ‰‹ shÇ’u) 'hand' and æ–¤ (jÄ«n) 'axe'.
	"Break off, break up; fold, bend; to curb, repress, maltreat, reprimand; punishment, suffering, affliction; divide; discern, judge, decide; diminish, deduct, reduce, rebate; to barter" --Karlgren.
	æŠ˜ is an old character, not the result of simplification. Another character æ‘º zhÃ© is completely unrelated in origin. æŠ˜ and æ‘º are different words; they were pronounced differently (æŠ˜ ending in -t, and æ‘º ending in -p), and still are in Cantonese. But in Mandarin they are both now pronounced zhÃ©, and by coincidence both have the meaning 'fold' (æŠ˜ also has various other meanings). So æ‘º tends to be replaced by æŠ˜, and æŠ˜ is regarded as a "simplified" form of æ‘º, but historically this isn't accurate. See æ‘º zhÃ©.

çº¯(Fç´”) [chÃºn] (çº¯æ´ chÃºnjiÃ©) pure; (å•çº¯ dÄnchÃºn) simple
From çºŸ(ç³¸ sÄ«) 'silk' and å±¯ tÃºn (village, collect) phonetic.
	"Pure silk, pure, genuine; good, fine, honest..." --Karlgren.

æ£‰ [miÃ¡n] cotton
From æœ¨ (mÃ¹) 'tree', ç™½ (bÇi) 'white' and å·¾ (jÄ«n) 'cloth'. Cotton is a plant that makes white cloth.
	Compare ç»µ(ç¶¿) miÃ¡n 'soft', å¸› bÃ³ 'silks', and é”¦(éŒ¦) jÇn 'brocade'.

å“ [Äi] (interjection:) hey; å“å‘€ ÄiyÄ; å“å“Ÿ ÄiyÅ  [Ä“i]
Compare å“€ Äi grief (æ‚²å“€), and å”‰ (oh, yes?), å—³ (ai).

è´¨(Fè³ª) [zhÃ¬] (ç‰©è´¨ wÃ¹zhÃ¬) matter, substance; è´¨é‡ zhÃ¬liÃ ng quality; mass
The full form è³ª has æ–¦ (two axes) (æ–¤ jÄ«n 'axe' doubled) on top of è² (bÃ¨i) 'money': a kilogram of money.
	The simple form è´¨, like the variant è²­, is altered to resemble ç›¾ dÃ¹n 'shield'.

é‡ [liÃ ng] amount; é‡è¯ classifier  [liÃ¡ng] measure
é‡ is composed of æ—¥ (rÃ¬) 'sun' over ä¸€ (yÄ«) 'one' over é‡Œ (lÇ) 'half kilometer'. The distance to the æ—¥ sun has been é‡ measured: it is exactly ä¸€ one é‡Œ li away. This is astronomically and etymologically absurd, but it might help you remember the character.
	The true explanation is obscure. The bottom is from é‡ zhÃ²ng 'heavy', which is a picture of a weighing machine. The top æ—¥ might be an object being weighed, or a contraction of è‰¯ liÃ¡ng phonetic.
	In dictionaries you will often see the character é‡ used as an abbreviation for é‡è¯ liÃ ngcÃ­ measure word, or classifier, an important part of speech in Chinese (like ä¸ª, æ, åŒ¹, etc).

æŒ‘ [tiÄo] (æŒ‘é€‰) choose  [tiÇo] poke; æŒ‘æˆ˜ challenge  [tÄo]
From æ‰Œ(æ‰‹ shÇ’u) 'hand' and å…† zhÃ o (omen, million, mega) phonetic.

å‰” [tÄ«] pick, scrape meat from a bone with a knife
From æ˜“ yÃ¬ (easy) and åˆ‚(åˆ€ dÄo) 'knife'.

é [fÄ“i] not, non-; éå¸¸ fÄ“ichÃ¡ng unusually
"Said to be a symbol of contrariety; I rather think it is a variation of é£› flying bird, homophonous to the abstract word here and therefore loaned" --Karlgren.
	Compare é£(é£›) fÄ“i 'fly'.

æ ‡(Fæ¨™) [biÄo] mark; æ ‡å‡† biÄozhÇ”n standard
From æœ¨ (mÃ¹) 'wood' and ç¥¨ piÃ o phonetic.
	ç¥¨ is abbreviated to ç¤º (show, indicate) in the simple form æ ‡.

å‡† [zhÇ”n] allow; (Fæº–) certainly; precise; å‡†å¤‡ prepare; æ ‡å‡† standard
Originally å‡†(æº–) zhÇ”n meant 'water level'. The full form æº– is composed of æ°µ(æ°´ shuÇ) 'water' and éš¼ sÇ”n ('falcon') phonetic.
	â€œA water-level; to level, equalize, fix; equal, certain, fixed; certainly; allow; often abbreviated into å‡†â€ --Karlgren(1923).
	The simple form å‡† is å†« (two-dot water) plus éš¹. Among simple form characters æº– is not used.
	Among full form characters, originally only æº– was used, but a distinction has sometimes been made between å‡† and æº–. å‡† is used for 'allow; grant; permit', as in å‡†è¨±, å‡†äºˆ, æ‰¹å‡† etc.; for 'according to', as in å‡†æ­¤. Also in å‡†å°‡ and å‡†å°‰. æº– is used for all other meanings. However, actual usage, even as prescribed by authorities, is a mess: both å‡† and æº– are used for 'quasi-', as in å‡†å¹³åŸ.
	A variant form is å‡–.

å»‰ [liÃ¡n] honest, clean; low-priced
From å¹¿ 'house' and å…¼ jiÄn (double, simultaneous, compatible) phonetic.
	"There was an Archaic kl- or gl- somewhere" says Karlgren, explaining how å…¼ jiÄn could be phonetic in å»‰ liÃ¡n. The old meaning was 'corner' of a å¹¿ house; corner --> square --> honest.

ä¹ [hÅ«] ä¼¼ä¹ sÃ¬hu it seems; å‡ ä¹ jÄ«hÅ« almost
"The seal contains ä¸‚ (qiÇo) exclamation; analysis of the rest doubtful" --Karlgren(1923).

äº‰(Fçˆ­) [zhÄ“ng] contend; dispute; æˆ˜äº‰ zhÃ nzhÄ“ng war; æ–—äº‰ struggle
Two hands (çˆ« and î¿­) struggling for possession of äº… a stick.
	In the simple form äº‰, the top is reduced from çˆ« to âºˆ.

é™ª [pÃ©i] (é™ªåŒ pÃ©itÃ³ng) accompany; é™ªå« pÃ©ijiÃ  dowry
From é˜(é˜œ fÃ¹) 'hill' and å’… pÇ’u (spit out) phonetic.
	"To wall up, strengthen; assist, bear company... etymologically the same word as åŸ¹ pÃ©i (foster, train, develop)" --Karlgren.
	Don't confuse é™ª pÃ©i with éƒ¨ bÃ¹ 'part', which has é˜(é‚‘ yÃ¬) 'city' on the right side.

é‡‘ [jÄ«n] (é‡‘å­ jÄ«nzi) gold (Au); (é‡‘å± jÄ«nshÇ”) metal
The bottom apparently came from åœŸ (tÇ”) 'earth' and (dots:) gold nuggets.
	The top was at one time ä»Š jÄ«n phonetic, but before that it may have been part of the picture of gold covered up in the ground.
	é‡‘ occurs as a component on the left side of characters, written (full form:) é‡’ or (simple form:) é’…, usually suggesting that the meaning is related to metal.

ç¨(Fç¨…) [shuÃ¬] tax
From ç¦¾ (hÃ©) 'grain' and å…‘(å…Œ) duÃ¬ (convert, exchange) phonetic. In ancient times, taxes may have been paid with grain rather than money.

å· [zhÅu] prefecture; å¹¿å· GuÇngzhÅu Canton
"Main lands inhabitable (isles or continents), surrounded by waters... composed of two å·› superposed. æ°´ä¸­å¯å±…æ›°å·ã€‚ä»é‡å·ã€‚ä¼šæ„" --Wieger.
	æ´² zhÅu 'continent' is written with æ°µ(æ°´ shuÇ) 'water' added.

ç­¾(Fç°½) [qiÄn] ç­¾è®¢ conclude & sign (treaty, etc); ç­¾å signature
From ç«¹ (zhÃº) 'bamboo' over ä½¥(åƒ‰) qiÄn (together) phonetic.
	The original meaning is bamboo slips for writing on, fortune telling, or drawing lots (æŠ½ç­¾).

æ”¶ [shÅu] gather; æ”¶æ‹¾ put in order; æ”¶è· harvest; æ”¶éŸ³æœº radio
From ä¸© (jiÅ«) 'hook' andæ”µ(æ”´ pÅ«) 'beat'.
	"To æ”´ mow with ä¸© a 'hook', a sickle" --Karglren.

æ®(Fæ“š) [jÃ¹] seize; depend on; (æ ¹æ® gÄ“njÃ¹) according to  [jÅ«] æ‹®æ®
From æ‰Œ(æ‰‹ shÇ’u) 'hand' and (full form:) è±¦ jÃ¹ or (simple form:) å±… jÅ« (live, reside) phonetic.

è¿ª [dÃ­] (ä¹¦) enlighten, guide
From ç”± and è¾¶(è¾µ chuÃ²) 'go'.

è¾¾(Fé”) [dÃ¡] reach, arrive    [dÄ] [tÃ ]
From å¤§ dÃ  phonetic and è¾¶(è¾µ chuÃ²) 'go'.
	The full form é” has åœŸ over ç¾Š in place of å¤§. Actually this åœŸ was originally å¤§ dÃ . An obsolete character ç¾ dÄ 'lamb' (å¤§ dÃ  phonetic over ç¾Š 'sheep') was phonetic in é”. But the simple form, with just å¤§, seems to be older than the full form.

æ–¯ [sÄ«] (thus; now used mostly for sound:) æ³•è¥¿æ–¯ Fascist
From å…¶ (qÃ­) 'basket' and æ–¤ (jÄ«n) 'axe'.
	"To æ–¤ split wood, fuel, and put into a å…¶ basket" --Karlgren.
