Lesson 13 Words compiled by Michael Huynh

寂 [jì] 寂寞 jìmò lonely; 寂静 quiet (place); 沉寂 quiet
From 宀 (mián) 'roof' and 叔 shū ('uncle') phonetic.

寞 [mò] 寂寞 jìmò lonely
From 宀 (mián) 'roof' and 莫 mò ('nothing') phonetic.

重 [zhòng] (沉重) heavy; 重要 important  [chóng] again
"The ancient characters represent round or flat weights piled up on a kind of support" --Wieger.
	"The small seal has 人 (rén) at the top, 土 (tǔ) at the bottom and 東 (dōng) phonetic in the middle; this is not original, for an older form is simply a picture of a weighing-machine, see WIEGER" --Karlgren.
	重 has no relation to 車(车 chē).

输(F輸) [shū] transport; lose (cf 赢 win)
From 车(車 chē) 'car' and 俞 yú ('boat') phonetic.
	"Bring tribute; pay tax; make a loss, lose; ruined" --Karlgren.

失 [shī] lose; 失败 shībài be defeated
A 手 (shǒu) hand and  something falling from it.
	Don't confuse 失 shī with 矢 shǐ 'arrow'.

强(F強) [qiáng] strong  [qiǎng] strive  [jiàng] 倔强 juéjiàng stubborn
The left side is 弓 gōng 'bow'. The right side 虽 is the modern simple form of 虽(雖) suī 'although'. A 弓 bow is strong, 虽 although it bends.
	The true explanation is obscure. An older form was 彊, with 畺 jiāng phonetic.
	"The character originally meant 'the larva of the corn-weevil' and was applied, as abbreviation for 彊, to the homophonous word 'strong'..." --Karlgren.
	The form 強 (with 厶 rather than 口) is one stroke less, but perversely we call 强 the "simple" form and 強 the "full" form, only because 强 is in the simple-form GB standard and 強 is in the full-form Big5 standard. This is one of those absurd situations where the "simple" form has more strokes than the "full" form.

速 [sù] fast; 速度 sùdù speed
From 束 shù (bundle) phonetic and 辶(辵 chuò) 'go'.

度 [dù] degree, extent; 制度 system   [duó] 猜度 cāiduó surmise
From 广 (guǎng) 'house', 廿 (niàn) 'twenty', and 又 (yòu) 'hand'.
	"To have 又 in one's hand 廿 (twenty:) all the inhabitants of 广 the house: rule, regulate, cf. 庶 and 妥" --Karlgren.
	Don't confuse 度 dù with 席 xí 'seat'.

练(F練) [liàn] white silk; (练习 liànxí) practice
The full form 練 is composed of 糸 (sī) 'silk' and 柬 jiǎn phonetic. The simple form 练 is 纟 plus . Notice that the component (柬 jiǎn) is not the same as 东(東 dōng 'east').
	"To boil and bleach raw silk; purify; to discipline, to drill, to practise" ---Karlgren.
	练(練) liàn 'white silk' is etymologically the same word as 炼(煉) liàn 'refine' (as in 锻炼 duànliàn 'exercise'). Compare 拣(揀) jiǎn 'choose'.

富 [fù] (富有 fùyǒu) rich; 丰富 fēngfù abundant; 财富 wealth
From 宀 (mián) 'roof' and an obsolete character 畐 fú 'abundance', which may have been a cognate word to 富 fù 'rich'. Compare 福 fú 'blessing', etc.

领(F領) [lǐng] to lead; collar; 领导, 领袖 leader; 本领 ability
From 令 lìng (make, cause) phonetic and 页(頁 yè) 'head'.
	"Neck; collar; (pull by the neck:) to lead, to direct; chief; (place on the neck, take upon oneself:) receive" --Karlgren.

追 [zhuī] pursue
From 𠂤 duī (mound pile) phonetic and 辶(辵 chuò) 'go'.

紧(F緊) [jǐn] tight; 紧张 jǐnzhāng tense; 要紧 yàojǐn important
From (臤) jiān (hard) phonetic over 糸 (sī) 'thread'.
	臤 is the old form of 坚(堅) jiān 'hard'.

秒 [miǎo] second (1/60 of a 分 minute)
From 禾 (hé) 'grain' and 少 (shǎo) 'few'.
	"Beard of grain; infinitesimal; a second of time or degree... the 少 thin thing on the 禾 grain" --Karlgren.
	Etymologically related to 杪 miǎo 'tip of twig', 渺 miǎo 'tiny', and 妙 miào 'subtle, wonderful'.

赢(F贏) [yíng] win
The signific component is 贝(貝 bèi) 'money'.
	The rest is from 驘, which is an old form of 骡(騾) luó 'mule'. Its function in 赢 yíng is unclear. 贝(貝) takes the place of 馬 (mǎ 'horse') at the bottom.
	Compare 羸, 蠃, 嬴.

决(F決) [jué] 解决 jiějué resolve; 决定 juédìng decide
From 冫 or 氵 (水 shuǐ) 'water' and 夬 guài 'break through'.
	"Bifurcation of a river; rupture, break off, cut off, decide; certainly..." --Karlgren.
	Cognate with 夬 guài (name of the hexagram ).

倒 [dǎo] fall down   [dào] backwards; pour; contrary to expectations ①fall over; topple
From 亻(人 rén) 'person' and 到 dào phonetic.

精 [jīng] perfect; 精神 spirit, essence; 酒精 alcohol
From 米 (mǐ) 'rice' and 青 qīng phonetic.
	Why 米 rice? Because rice is PERFECT every time. Rice is the ESSENCE of Chinese food, and is used to make ALCOHOL (酒精).

彩 [cǎi] (色彩 sècǎi) color; 彩色 cǎisè multicolor
From 采 cǎi 'pick' and 彡 (shān) 'feathers'.
	"Etymologically the same word as 采; character specifyingly enlarged by 彡" --Karlgren.
	Compare 形 xíng 'shape' and 影 yǐng 'shadow'.

封 [fēng] to seal; 封建 feudal; 信封 envelope
The left side 圭 (guī) means a token used in conferring fiefs (pieces of land). It 土 (tǔ) 'land' doubled (and therefore 6 strokes, not 5).
	The right side 寸 (cùn) is the hand of the feudal Great Prince, who vests families with fiefs by putting his 封 seal on official documents.

展 [zhǎn] spread out; 发展 develop; 展览 exhibit
The top is 尸 (shī) 'body'. The remainder derives from an obsolete character which was phonetic.

牌 [pái] tablet; brand; cards; dominoes: 牌子 sign
From 片 (piàn) 'slice' and 卑 bēi phonetic.

此 [cǐ] this; 如此 like this (=这样); 此地 here (=这里)\
The left side is 止 zhǐ 'stop' (picture of a foot). The right side 匕 depicted a person standing, facing to the right (originally the mirror image of 人 rén 'person'). The place where a person has stopped; here; this.

感 [gǎn] (感觉) feel; (感情) emotion
From 咸 xián phonetic and 心 (xīn) 'heart'.

骄(F驕) [jiāo] 骄傲 jiāo'ào arrogant, proud
From 马(馬 mǎ) 'horse' and 乔(喬) qiáo (surname, arbor) phonetic.

From 亻(人 rén) 'person' and 敖 áo. See 敖 áo for explanation.
	The middle part is  over 万.

整 [zhěng] (整个) whole; 调整 tiáozhěng adjust; 整齐 zhěngqí neat
From 敕 (chì) 'imperial command' over 正 zhèng 'straight, correct'. 整 and 正 are cognate.
	"(Make straight:) regulate, arrange, adjust, repair; complete, whole -- the signific is 敕 command; certain commentators, however, take the parts separately: 'to 束 bind and 攵 beat a little, so as to make it 正 straight'" --Karlgren.

光 [guāng] light; merely; 阳光 sunlight; 光荣 glory
Originally 火 (huǒ) 'fire' over 人 (rén) 'person'.

荣(F榮) [róng] (光荣, 荣誉) glory, honor
The top is 荧(熒) yíng phonetic, abbreviated to 𤇾 in the full form, and  in the simple form. The bottom is 木 (mù) 'tree'.
	Compare 劳(勞) láo 'labor', 营(營) yíng 'camp'.

际(F際) [jì] (边际 biānjì) boundary; 实际 reality; 国际 international
From 阝(阜 fù) 'hill' and 祭 jì phonetic.
	祭 is abbreviated to 示 shì in the simple form 际.

取 [qǔ] take, get, fetch
From 耳 (ěr) 'ear' and 又 (yòu) 'hand'.
	To 又 grab by the 耳 ear, pick up.

成 [chéng] (成为, 变成) become; 成功 succeed; 完成 perfect
Here 戊 (wù 'weapon') is short for 茂 (mào) 'flourishing, luxuriant', which suggests the meaning 'succeed'. The little inside stroke 乛 was originally 丁 dīng phonetic.

绩(F績) [jì] 成绩 grade, achievement; 功绩 merits & achievements
From 纟(糸 sī) 'silk thread' and 责(責) zé phonetic.
	"To twist, spin; achieve, finish; achievement, meritorious deed" --Karlgren.
	绩 jī still has the meaning 'to twist hempen thread', but this is not a common word.
	Formerly the standard pronunciation of 绩 was jī, but jì is now official.

庆(F慶) [qìng] 庆祝 celebrate; 庆贺 congratulate; 庆幸 rejoice
The full form 慶 is composed of 鹿 (lù) 'deer' (abbreviated), 心 xīn 'heart', and 夂 (zhǐ) 'walk slowly'.
	"To 夂 come and present a 鹿 deer to express one's 心 good wishes" --Karlgren.
	The simple form 庆 is 广 over 大.

参(F參) [cān] 参加 participate  [shēn] 人参 ginseng  [cēn] 参差
An old form was 曑.
	"The 'three star' constellation: Orion... three objects or persons together; come together, mix; consult with, advise, assist; go and visit; impeach -- the three stars of Orion signific; function of 㐱 uncertain..." --Karlgren(1923).

益 [yì] (利益 lìyì) advantage, profit;  Increase
From 水 (shuǐ) 'water' turned sideways (it looks just like ☵ Kǎn in the seal character), over 皿 (mǐn) 'dish'.
	"It represents a 皿 vase, so full of 水 water, that it overflows. This circumstance is represented by the fact that 水 is over the vase and is bent down, thus expressing its overflowing. By extension, addition, profit, excess, overplus." --Wieger.

誉(F譽) [yù] praise; 荣誉 róngyù honor; 名誉 míngyù fame
From 與 yǔ phonetic over 言 (yán) 'words'.
	與 on top is abbreviated to 兴 (xìng) in the simple form 誉.
	Compare 举(舉) jǔ.

奥(F奧) [ào] 奥秘 àomì secret, mystery; 奥妙 àomiào profound, secret
"Southwest corner of the house, place of the lares; quiet, dark, mysterious -- the seal has 廾 instead of 大; said to mean the part of 宀 the house where you have to 釆 feel with the hands; I think rather: where you 廾 offer up 米 rice to the lares -- 釆 and 米 being very similar in the seal and often confused" --Karlgren.
	("Lares" are the guardian spirits of a house.)

匹 [pǐ] (量) measure word for horses: 三匹马 3 horses
Karlgren says 八 bā is phonetic:
	"Assort, assorted, equal, corresponding to; one of a pair, mate; (one of several:) ordinary, common, vulgar; measure of cloth (40 feet long) -- the signific is 匸 box (assort)" --Karlgren(1923).
	Wieger's explanation is completely different:
	"Half of a whole. The whole is represented by 四. A little more than the half of 四 was kept, so that the character is still recognisable; 分四为二也。一夫也。偶也。That which, being joined with its like, forms a pair, a match. See the compound 甚."

克 [kè] (克服 kèfú) overcome; gram; (F剋) 克期 set time limit  [kēi] (=剋)
克 used to look like 皮 (pí) 'skin', minus 又 (yòu) 'hand', plus an extra thing on top. It resembled 革 (gé) 'leather', which depicts an animal being flayed. To overcome an animal?
	Anyway, 克 kè appears to have no historical relation to 古 gǔ or 兄 xiōng.
	The variant form 剋 has 刂(刀 dāo) 'knife' added. Another variant, 尅, has 寸 (cùn) 'hand' added.
