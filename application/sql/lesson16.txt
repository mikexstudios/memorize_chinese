Lesson 16 Words compiled by Michael Huynh

ä¸(Fèˆ‡) [yÇ”] and  [yÃ¹] å‚ä¸ cÄnyÃ¹ participate in  [yÃº]
Originally from ä¸€ (yÄ«) 'one' and å‹º (shÃ¡o) 'spoon'. The meaning was 'give, grant'; possibly to give one spoonful of food to a child.
	The full form èˆ‡ was made by adding èˆ yÃº 'lift' (two pairs of hands) to ä¸. èˆ yÃº was phonetic; two pairs of hands also could depict the giver and the receiver.
	Compare å…´(èˆˆ) xÃ¬ng (the full forms are similar).

ç–—(Fç™‚) [liÃ¡o] treat, cure; ç–—æ³• therapy

	"To åˆ€ trim a large tree with many branches" --Karlgren.
