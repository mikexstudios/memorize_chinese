è®®(Fè­°) [yÃ¬] (è®®è®º yÃ¬lÃ¹n) discuss; ä¼šè®® conference; å»ºè®® suggest
From è® (è¨€ yÃ¡n) 'words' and ä¹‰(ç¾©) yÃ¬ 'justice'.
	è®® is cognate with ä¹‰.
	"(Discuss what is right:) deliberate upon, criticise" --Karlgren.

ç ” [yÃ¡n] grind; (ç ”ç©¶ yÃ¡njiÅ«) study
From çŸ³ (shÃ­) 'stone' and å¼€(å¹µ) qiÄn phonetic. The right side is now written like å¼€ kÄi 'open', but it was a originally a character å¹µ qiÄn 'level', composed of å¹² (gÄn) doubled. å¹µ is obsolete. In ç ” yÃ¡n the horizontal strokes were joined to look like å¼€ kÄi. The lower part of å¹¶ bÃ¬ng has the same origin.

ç©¶ [jiÅ«] ç ”ç©¶ yÃ¡njiÅ« study, research; ç©¶ç«Ÿ after all
From ç©´ (xuÃ©) 'hole' and ä¹ jiÇ” phonetic.

From ç–’ (nÃ¬) 'sick' and çŸ¥ zhÄ« ('know') phonetic.

å‘† [dÄi] stupid; stay; å‘†æ¿ dÄibÇn stiff  [Ã¡i] å‘†æ¿ Ã¡ibÇn stiff
å‘† was the old form of ä¿ bÇo 'protect'. After ä¿ had äº»(äºº rÃ©n) 'person' added to it, å‘† came to be used as an abbreviation of çƒ Ã¡i, dÄi 'stupid'. This happened long ago, so å‘† is used now instead of çƒ among both full form and simple form characters.
	Also see é¨ƒ.

ç—‡(Fç™¥) [zhÃ¨ng] disease; å¥å¿˜ç—‡ amnesia  [zhÄ“ng] ç—‡ç»“
From ç–’ (nÃ¬) 'sick' and (full form:) å¾µ zhÄ“ng or (simple form:) æ­£ zhÃ¨ng phonetic.

è§£ [jiÄ›] separate; explain  [XiÃ¨] (surname) [jiÃ¨] è§£é€
From è§’ (jiÇo) 'horn', åˆ€ (dÄo) 'knife', and ç‰› (niÃº) 'ox'.

å‰– [pÅu] è§£å‰– jiÄ›pÅu dissect; å‰–é¢ section; å‰–æ analyse

çŒ´ [hÃ³u] (çŒ´å­ hÃ³uzi) monkey
From çŠ­(çŠ¬ quÇn) 'dog' and ä¾¯ hÃ³u phonetic.

	In the full form ç¹” the phonetic part is æˆ  zhÃ­.

è£˜ [qiÃº] (ä¹¦) fur coat
From æ±‚ qiÃº and è¡£ clothing. æ±‚ qiÃº was originally a picture of a fur coat; it was borrowed for the word qiÃº 'seek' and è¡£ clothing was added to form è£˜ qiÃº with the original meaning.

è£…(Fè£) [zhuÄng] dress up; load; install; (å‡è£… jiÇzhuÄng) pretend â‘ outfit; dress; clothing; costume
From å£®(å£¯) zhuÃ ng (robust, magnificant) phonetic and è¡£ (yÄ«) 'clothing'.

From é›‡ gÃ¹ phonetic and é¡µ(é  yÃ¨) 'head'. In the simple form é¡¾, é›‡ is replaced by å„ (Ã¨ 'disaster').

æ‰” [rÄ“ng] throw, toss; æ‰”çƒ throw a ball (cf æ¥çƒ)
From æ‰Œ(æ‰‹ shÇ’u) 'hand' and ä¹ƒ nÇi.
	Compare ä» rÃ©ng 'still, remain'.

è›‹ [dÃ n] egg; é¸¡è›‹ chicken egg; è›‹ç™½è´¨ protein
From ç–‹ (shÇ”, old measure word for horses) over è™« (chÃ³ng) 'reptile'.
	"ç–‹ is here a vulgar corruption of the å»¶ yÃ¡n (prolong) of the seal which is phonetic..." --Karlgren.

å‰ª [jiÇn] (å‰ªåˆ€ jiÇndÄo) scissors; cut (with scissors); clip; trim

	"The å·³ fetus wrapped in the å‹¹ womb" --Wieger.

å›´(Fåœ) [wÃ©i] surround; å›´æ£‹ wÃ©iqÃ­ (Go)
From å›— wÃ©i 'surround' and éŸ¦(éŸ‹) wÃ©i phonetic.
	Originally this word was written å›—, representing an enclosure. The phonetic part éŸ¦(éŸ‹) wÃ©i was subsequently added.

å¼„ [nÃ²ng] do   [lÃ²ng] é‡Œå¼„ alley â‘ play with â‘¡make; do; handle; engage in â‘¢obtain; get; fetch

ç³Ÿ [zÄo] rotten; ç³Ÿç³• zÄogÄo bad luck! ç³Ÿè¸ zÄota waste, spoil
From ç±³ (mÇ) 'rice' and æ›¹ cÃ¡o phonetic.
	Compare é­ zÄo 'meet with disaster'.

ç‰º(FçŠ§) [xÄ«] ç‰ºç‰² xÄ«shÄ“ng sacrifice
From ç‰› (niÃº) 'ox' and (full form:) ç¾² xÄ« (a legendary genius) or (simple form:) è¥¿ xÄ« phonetic.
	The ox is the sacrificial victim.

ç‰² [shÄ“ng] ç‰ºç‰² xÄ«shÄ“ng sacrifice; ç‰²å£ beasts of burden â‘ livestock
From ç‰› (niÃº) 'ox' and ç”Ÿ shÄ“ng.

è®²(Fè¬›) [jiÇng] speak â‘ speak; say; tell â‘¡explain; make clear; interpret â‘¢discuss; negotiate â‘£stress; pay attention to; be particular about
From è® (è¨€ yÃ¡n) 'words' and å†“ gÃ²u (simplified to äº• jÇng, water well) phonetic.
	(Karlgren supplies evidence that å†“ gÃ²u really was phonetic in è¬› jiÇng; in modern Mandarin äº• jÇng makes a better phonetic even though it derives graphically from the top of å†“.)

éªŒ(Fé©—) [yÃ n] (ç»éªŒ jÄ«ngyÃ n) experience
From é©¬(é¦¬ mÇ) 'horse' and ä½¥(åƒ‰) qiÄn (together, agree) phonetic.

è¯¯(Fèª¤) [wÃ¹] (é”™è¯¯ cuÃ²wÃ¹) mistake â‘ miss (due to delay) â‘¡harm; injure
From è® (è¨€ yÃ¡n) 'words' and å´(å³) wÃº (Surname) phonetic.

çºª(Fç´€) [jÃ¬] ä¸–çºª century; çºªå¿µ memento; çºªå¾‹ discipline  [JÇ]
From çºŸ(ç³¸ sÄ«) 'silk thread' and å·± jÇ (self).
	"Unravel threads; arrange, regulate, law; to record, year, age, dynasty" --Karlgren.
	This was the original meaning of å·± jÇ, and when å·± was borrowed for the sixth å¤©å¹² (and also the meaning 'self'), ç³¸ was added to produce ç´€. Now çºª jÃ¬ is pronounced in the fourth (falling) tone, but when used as a proper name, it is JÇ.
	It seems likely that è®° jÃ¬ 'record, remember' is etymologically the same word, considering the overlap in meaning. Some words can be written with either çºª or è®°: è®°å½•(çºªå½•) 'keep minutes', çºªè¦(è®°è¦) 'summary of minutes'. (However, Karlgren makes no mention of the possibility of çºª and è®° being etymologically related, nor of å·± being a picture of threads.)

è™ [nÃ¼Ã¨] cruel; è™å¾… mistreat
From è™(è™ hÇ”) 'tiger' and çˆª (zhuÇ) 'claws' (sideways).
	"Cruelly destroy; oppress -- the seal shows the lower part to be çˆª, here turned on the side; the çˆª claws of the è™ tiger" --Karlgren.
	Etymologically the same word as ç–Ÿ(ç˜§) nÃ¼Ã¨ 'fever'.

å¾… [dÃ i] treat; entertain; wait for   [dÄi] (=å‘†) stay
From å½³ (chÃ¬) 'footstep' and å¯º sÃ¬ ('temple') phonetic.

é‡ [yÄ›] wild
From é‡Œ (lÇ) 'village' and äºˆ yÇ” (give, grant, I) phonetic.
	é‡Œ contains åœŸ (tÇ”) 'land' and ç”° (tiÃ¡n) 'field'. é‡ yÄ› means wild land that has not been cultivated.

è›®(Fè ») [mÃ¡n] é‡è›® yÄ›mÃ¡n barbaric; è›®æ¨ª mÃ¡nhÃ¨ng unreasonable
From î¿‹(äœŒ) luÃ¡n phonetic and è™« (chÃ³ng) 'reptile'.

ç™Œ [Ã¡i] (ç™Œç—‡ Ã¡izhÃ¨ng) cancer
From ç–’ (nÃ¬) 'sick' and åµ’ yÃ¡n phonetic.
	åµ’ was an old form of å²© yÃ¡n 'rock'. åµ’ is composed of å“ (pÇn) three rocks over å±± (shÄn) 'mountain'. ç™Œ Ã¡i was formerly pronounced yÃ¡n.

è‰¾ [Ã i] Chinese mugwort; è‰¾ç»’ Ã irÃ³ng moxa  [yÃ¬] æ€¨è‰¾ yuÃ nyÃ¬ resentment
From è‰¹(è‰ cÇo) 'grass' and ä¹‚ yÃ¬ (regulate, put in order) phonetic.

æ»‹ [zÄ«] æ»‹å‘³ zÄ«wÃ¨i flavor; æ»‹é•¿ zÄ«zhÇng grow
From æ°µ(æ°´ shuÇ) 'water' and å…¹ zÄ« phonetic.
	"Mud, muddy; juicy, rich, fertile; grow, multiply; turbulent, provoke" --Karlgren.

å‡­(Fæ†‘) [pÃ­ng] lean on; based on; no matter ( = ä¸è®º)
The full form æ†‘ is é¦® pÃ­ng phonetic over å¿ƒ (xÄ«n) 'heart'. The simple form å‡­ is ä»» (rÃ¨n) 'no matter' over å‡  (jÄ«) 'table' (a table is something you can lean on; possibly 'chair' is a better translation).
	å‡­ and æ†‘ are both old characters. è¯´æ–‡ (100 A.D.) contains å‡­ but not æ†‘. A variant form å‡´ is é¦® over å‡ .

ç [zhÄ“n] (çå®) treasure: çç  pearl; çè´µ precious
From ç‹(ç‰ yÃ¹) 'jade' and ã± zhÄ›n phonetic.
	A rare variant form is ç.

ç¨€ [xÄ«] scarce; watery; ç¨€é¥­ gruel
From ç¦¾ (hÃ©) 'grain' and å¸Œ xÄ«.
	Etymologically the same word as å¸Œ xÄ«.

æ¿’(Fç€•) [bÄ«n] be close to (sea or river); be on the brink of
From æ°µ(æ°´ shuÇ) 'water' and é¢‘(é ») pÃ­n phonetic.

ä¸´(Fè‡¨) [lÃ­n] overlook; be adjacent to; ï€ Approach; ä¸´æ—¶ temporary
A person with a big eye, bending over and looking closely at some objects.
	å“ pÇn represents the objects, and is phonetic at the same time ("There was an Archaic pl- or bl- somewhere in this group" --Karlgren).
	Compare å§ wÃ² 'lie down', è‡£ chÃ©n 'minister', and ç›‘(ç›£) jiÄn 'supervise'.

ç»(Fçµ•) [juÃ©] cut off; absolute â‘ exhausted; used up; finished
The left side is çºŸ(ç³¸ sÄ«) 'thread'.
	The right side is âºˆ or åˆ€ (dÇo) 'knife' over å·´ (which was originally ã”¾ or å© jiÃ© phonetic). In the variant form çµ¶ and simple form ç», the right side is written just like è‰² (sÃ¨ 'color').
	"Has nothing to do with è‰², for the seal has: to åˆ€ cut a ç³¸ thread, signific, and ã”¾ phonetic" --Karlgren(1923).

æ€(Fæ…‹) [tÃ i] form; æ€åº¦ tÃ idu manner; çŠ¶æ€ zhuÃ ngtÃ i state
From å¤ª tÃ i phonetic over å¿ƒ (xÄ«n) 'heart'. The full form æ…‹ has èƒ½ nÃ©ng on top, instead of å¤ª (the reason is obscure).

é¿ [bÃ¬] (é¿å… bÃ¬miÇn) avoid; é€ƒé¿ tÃ¡obÃ¬ escape, evade
From è¾Ÿ bÃ¬ and è¾¶(è¾µ chuÃ²) 'go'.

å… [miÇn] exempt; é¿å… bÃ¬miÇn avoid; å…è´¹ miÇnfÃ¨i free
"Get off, escape; avoid; to spare, remit -- picture of a running hare" --Karlgren.
	Compare å…” tÃ¹ 'rabbit' which is the same except for an additional dot.

å°½ [jÃ¬n] (Fç›¡) use up  [jÇn] (Få„˜) to max extent; å°½ç®¡ even though
The simple form å°½ is drastically abbreviated. The top of ç›¡ contains a derivative of è¿ (yÃ¹), now obsolete, which is also phonetic in æ´¥ jÄ«n. The four dots ç¬ are ç« huÇ’ 'fire', and the bottom is çš¿ mÇn 'bowl', or in this case, a brazier in which the fire burns. The primitive meaning was 'ashes', which is now written çƒ¬(ç‡¼) jÃ¬n, with the addition of another ç«.
	"By extension, ended, finished (the ashes being the final result of the combustion), an action that went to its term, consummation, exhaustion" --Wieger.
Two full forms ç›¡ jÃ¬n and å„˜ jÇn are distinguished, å„˜ with the addition of äº»(äºº rÃ©n) being used when the pronounciation is jÇn. JÃ¬n and jÇn are cognate words. There is only one simple form å°½.

ç—› [tÃ²ng] painful; ç—›è‹¦ tÃ²ngkÇ” suffering; ç—›å¿« tÃ²ngkuai delighted
From ç–’ (nÃ¬) 'sick' and ç”¬ yÇ’ng phonetic.

è™š(Fè™›) [xÅ«] empty, void; è°¦è™š modest; è™šå¿ƒ open-minded; ç©ºè™š hollow
è™ hÇ” (è™ 'tiger') is phonetic. The bottom is from an old form of ä¸˜ (qiÅ«) 'hill', signific. In the full form è™›, the bottom has six strokes; in the simple form è™š, the bottom is ä¸š (yÃ¨), five strokes.
	"A high upland; å¤§ä¸˜ä¹Ÿã€‚ä»ä¸˜, è™å£°ã€‚These uplands being generally wild and barren, hence è½¬æ³¨ zhuÇnzhÃ¹, empty, that which contains nothing; å¤§ä¸˜ç©ºæ—·, æ•…è™šé–‘ä¹Ÿ, ç©ºä¹Ÿã€‚" --Wieger.

è£(Fæ¦®) [rÃ³ng] (å…‰è£, è£èª‰) glory, honor
The top is è§(ç†’) yÃ­ng phonetic, abbreviated to í¡í·¾ in the full form, and î¿“ in the simple form. The bottom is æœ¨ (mÃ¹) 'tree'.
	Compare åŠ³(å‹) lÃ¡o 'labor', è¥(ç‡Ÿ) yÃ­ng 'camp'.

åŒº(Få€) [qÅ«] (åœ°åŒº dÃ¬qÅ«) area; åŒºåˆ« difference [ÅŒu] (surname)
The full form å€ is å“ (pÇn) inside åŒš. In the simple form åŒº, å“ is replaced by ã….
	"To dispose, to stow away å“ things in a åŒš box; ä»å“åœ¨åŒšä¸­, ä¼šæ„ã€‚By extension, lodging, place, site; å››æ–¹ä¹Ÿã€‚" --Wieger.
	Two words, qÅ« and Åu, were synonymous and both represented by the character åŒº(å€); now the pronunciation Åu survives only as a surname. åŒº is phonetic in many characters, some pronounced qÅ«, such as èº¯é©±å²–, and others pronounced Åu, such as æ¬§é¸¥æ®´æ²¤è®´ç“¯.

ç¨€ [xÄ«] scarce; watery; ç¨€é¥­ gruel
From ç¦¾ (hÃ©) 'grain' and å¸Œ xÄ«.
	Etymologically the same word as å¸Œ xÄ« (hope).

å¢ [zÄ“ng] (å¢åŠ  zÄ“ngjiÄ, å¢é•¿ zÄ“ngzhÇng) increase
From åœŸ (tÇ”) 'land' and æ›¾ cÃ©ng (in the past) phonetic.

è™ [hÇ”] (è€è™ lÇohÇ”) tiger   [hÅ«] é©¬é©¬è™è™   [hÃ¹] è™ä¸æ‹‰
The form on the far left is very old, from an inscription in bronze from the å•† ShÄng dynasty (16th to 11th centuries B.C.). Obviously it is a picture of a tiger. But as it became distorted, people couldn't tell what it was and interpreted it as a picture of the tiger's stripes only. The form è™ was then enlarged by adding å„¿ feet, even though it already had feet, except that you can't really tell where the feet are in è™. So the modern form is è™, while è™ occurs as a part of other characters such as è™‘ lÇœ 'consider', etc.
	è™ (or è™) is the 141st of the 214 radicals.

é‡‡ [cÇi] pick, gather (Fæ¡)  [cÃ i] (FåŸ°) é‡‡åœ° cÃ idÃ¬ fief
From çˆ« (zhÇo) 'hand' and æœ¨ (mÃ¹) 'tree'.
	A çˆ« hand reaching to pick fruit from a æœ¨ tree (in the oracle bone character, fruits were shown on the tree, just like æœ guÇ’).
	Etymologically the same word as å½© cÇi 'multi-color' (various colors specially gathered), and cognate with èœ cÃ i 'vegetables, greens' (picked from the ground).
	é‡‡ has eight strokes, not to be confused with the component é‡† biÃ n which has only seven strokes. Strangely, however, the radical of é‡‡ cÇi is é‡† biÃ n, not çˆª zhÇo.
	A variant form is æ¡ ("tautologically enlarged by æ‰‹" --Karlgren), which among full form characters is interchangeable with é‡‡ in many (though not all) contexts.
	For cÃ i as in cÃ idÃ¬ and cÃ iyÃ¬ 'fief', the variant forms åŸ° and å¯€, with åœŸ 'earth' or å®€ 'roof' added, are interchangeable with é‡‡ among full form characters.

æª [cuÃ²] æªæ–½ cuÃ²shÄ« measure, step
From æ‰Œ(æ‰‹ shÇ’u) 'hand' and æ˜” xÄ« (former times, in the past) phonetic.
	Don't confuse æª cuÃ² with é”™ cuÃ², which would be a mistake.

æ–½ [shÄ«] carry out; æªæ–½ cuÃ²shÄ« measure, step; æ–½å·¥ construction
From î¿ˆ (yÇn) 'flag' and ä¹Ÿ yÄ› phonetic.
	î¿ˆ depicts a flag; it is also a component in æ—— qÃ­ 'flag', æ— zÃº 'nationality', etc. It has no relation to æ–¹ fÄng.
	Compare æ‹– tuÅ 'drag', composed of æ‰Œ and ãŒ.

è®¾(Fè¨­) [shÃ¨] set up; å»ºè®¾ construct; è®¾è®¡ design; è®¾å¤‡ equipment
From è® (è¨€ yÃ¡n) 'words' and æ®³ (shÅ«) 'beat'.
	"To è¨€ command and æ®³ beat" --Karlgren.
	Compare æŠ• tÃ³u 'throw'.

å®(Få¯¶) [bÇo] treasure
From å®€ (miÃ¡n) 'roof' over ç‰ (yÃ¹) 'jade'. Treasure stored in a house. The full form å¯¶ also contains ç¼¶ (fÇ’u) 'jar' and è² (bÃ¨i) 'money'.

ç†Š [xiÃ³ng] bear; ç†ŠçŒ« xiÃ³ngmÄo panda
From èƒ½ (nÃ©ng) 'bear' and ç¬ (ç« huÇ’) 'fire'. èƒ½ depicted a bear; now it is used for the word nÃ©ng 'able'. Whether the added ç¬ four dots depict the bear's feet, or ç« fire cooking bear meat, is uncertain.

è–„ [bÃ³] slight [bÃ¡o] thin; è–„å¼± weak  [bÃ²] è–„è· peppermint â‘¡weak; light
From è‰¹(è‰ cÇo) 'grass' and æº¥ pÇ” phonetic.

å¼± [ruÃ²] weak; å¾®å¼± wÄ“iruÃ² faint; è½¯å¼± ruÇnruÃ² feeble
"Some commentators interpret this as a picture of the wings of a young bird, not yet fully grown out, cf. ç¾½ (yÇ”)" --Karlgren.
	Another possibility is that å¼± contains å¼“ (gÅng) 'bow' doubled, plus some dots, which might indicate some sort of weakness in the bow. Notice that å¼º qiÃ¡ng 'strong' also contains å¼“ 'bow'.

å¿½ [hÅ«] disregard; (å¿½ç„¶ hÅ«rÃ¡n) suddenly; (å¿½è€Œ) now...
From å‹¿ wÃ¹ phonetic and å¿ƒ (xÄ«n) 'heart'.
	The top is å‹¿ wÃ¹, not åŒ†(æ‚¤) cÅng.

ç•¥ [lÃ¼Ã¨] brief, slight; ç•¥å¾® lÃ¼Ã¨wÄ“i slightly â‘£omit; delete; leave outâ‘¤overlook
From ç”° (tiÃ¡n) 'field' and å„ gÃ¨ phonetic ("There was an Archaic kl- or gl-" --Karlgren).
	The primitive meaning was 'to draw boundary lines', hence ç”° 'field' (compare ç–† jiÄng). Extended meanings: outline, sketch, brief.

äº’ [hÃ¹] äº’ç›¸ each other; ç›¸äº’ reciprocal
"Symbol: two hooks gripping each other" --Karlgren.
