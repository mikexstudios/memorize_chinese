è¾› [xÄ«n] 8th å¤©å¹²; suffering; è¾›è‹¦ xÄ«nkÇ” work hard
"The seal has í¡ˆí¶‰ 'knock against, offend' below, and äº  above; the scholastic commentators say: to offend (äº  = ) ä¸Š the superiors" --Karlgren.

å‹¤ [qÃ­n] (å‹¤åŠ³ qÃ­nlÃ¡o) diligent, hardworking
From å ‡ jÇn (violet (flower)) phonetic and åŠ› (lÃ¬) 'strength'.

ä¹ [fÃ¡] (ç¼ºä¹quÄ“fÃ¡) lack; ç–²ä¹ pÃ­fÃ¡ tired; è´«ä¹ pÃ­nfÃ¡ poor
The seal form of ä¹ was the mirror image of æ­£ zhÃ¨ng 'correct'.
	"The inversion means that one did not æ­¢ reach the ä¸€ line, the point where one had to reach; a defect, to be in want of, exhausted. The modern character is a fanciful abbreviation that has nothing in common with ä¹‹ zhÄ«" --Wieger.

è½½(Fè¼‰) [zÃ i] carry, be loaded with  [zÇi] è®°è½½ put down in writing
From è½¦(è»Š chÄ“) 'car' and í¡Ší¶ zÃ¡i (cut) phonetic.

æœ [chÃ¡o] towards; dynasty; æœé²œ ChÃ¡oxiÄn Korea  [zhÄo] (morning)
The left side í¡‚í¶ depicts the æ—¥ (rÃ¬) sun rising between the plants. The right side was not originally æœˆ (yuÃ¨) 'moon'; its origin is obscure (the seal character had èˆŸ zhÅu phonetic; older forms had something else).
	"Dawn, morning; ...morning ceremony, imperial audience, go to an audience; court; dynasty" --Karlgren.
	æœ zhÄo 'morning' is cognate to æ½® chÃ¡o 'morning tide'.

æˆ˜(Fæˆ°) [zhÃ n] (æˆ˜äº‰ zhÃ nzhÄ“ng) war
From (full form:) å–® dÄn or (simple form:) å  zhÄn phonetic, and æˆˆ (gÄ“) 'spear'.

ç§¦ [QÃ­n] the Qin (Ch'in) Dynasty, 221-207 B.C. (QÃ­n --> China)
From î¿” 'hands holding pestle' over ç¦¾ (hÃ©) 'grain'.
	Originally a kind of rice, then the name of the valley where this rice grew and the short-lived but infamous QÃ­n state originated.
	"Below, ç¦¾; above, the seal has å»¾ (î¿Ÿ) two hands holding åˆ a pestle, now badly contracted" --Karlgren(1923). In the earliest forms, ç¦¾ was doubled.

å§‹ [shÇ] (å¼€å§‹ kÄishÇ) begin, start; å§‹ç»ˆ shÇzhÅng all along
From å¥³ (nÇš) 'woman' and å° tÃ¡i (platform, etc.) phonetic.

Composed of ç™½ (bÃ¡i 'white') over ç‹ (wÃ¡ng) 'king'.
	The top was originally è‡ª (zÃ¬) 'self', which became ç™½.

å½¢ [xÃ­ng] (å½¢å¼ xÃ­ngshÃ¬) form; shape; å½¢æˆ xÃ­ngchÃ©ng to form
The å½¡ three lines represent the shadow, and thus the shape, of an object (as in å½± yÇng). The left side å¼€ formerly looked like äº• jÇng 'well'. No relation to å¼€(é–‹) kÄi 'open'.
	According to Karlgren, äº• here was abbreviated from è€• gÄ“ng phonetic; the same applies to åˆ‘ xÃ­ng 'punishment'. Another theory is that the left side äº• (now å¼€) simply represented a frame, suggesting the meaning pattern, shape, form (--Henshall).

æ™‹(Fæ™‰) [jÃ¬n] promote; a dynasty (265-420); ï€º Progress
The top äºš was originally two arrows pointing downwards, like è‡³ (zhÃ¬) 'arrive' doubled. The bottom is æ—¥ (rÃ¬) 'sun'.
	Etymologically, æ™‹ jÃ¬n appears to be the same word as è¿›(é€²) jÃ¬n.
	"è¿›ä¹Ÿã€‚æ—¥å‡º, ä¸‡ç‰©è¿›ã€‚æ˜“æ›°æ˜å‡º, åœ°ä¸Šæ™‹ã€‚ä»æ—¥, ä»äºŒè‡³, ä¼šæ„ã€‚" --è¯´æ–‡è§£å­— (æ˜“ here means æ˜“ç» The Book of Changes).
	"The è‡³ arriving, advancing æ—¥ sun?" --Karlgren(1923).
	Compare æ™® pÇ”.

éš‹ [SuÃ­] Sui Dynasty (581-618)
From é˜(é˜œ fÃ¹) 'hill', and å·¦ zuÇ’ phonetic over æœˆ(è‚‰ rÃ²u 'meat').
	Compare éš(éš¨) suÃ­ and æƒ° duÃ².

å” [tÃ¡ng] (surname); Tang Dynasty; (å”çª tÃ¡ngtÅ«) rude
From åºš (gÄ“ng) 'pound rice' and å£ (kÇ’u) 'mouth'.
	"The å£ words that accompany the åºš pounding of rice; idle gossip, noisy wrangle" --Wieger.
	"From å£ and åºš, interpretation uncertain" --Karlgren.
	Phonetic in å¡˜ tÃ¡ng 'dyke'; ç³– tÃ¡ng 'sugar'; æª tÃ¡ng 'ward off'.

å¼± [ruÃ²] weak; å¾®å¼± wÄ“iruÃ² faint; è½¯å¼± ruÇnruÃ² feeble
"Some commentators interpret this as a picture of the wings of a young bird, not yet fully grown out, cf. ç¾½ (yÇ”)" --Karlgren.
	Another possibility is that å¼± contains å¼“ (gÅng) 'bow' doubled, plus some dots, which might indicate some sort of weakness in the bow. Notice that å¼º qiÃ¡ng 'strong' also contains å¼“ 'bow'.

å®‹ [SÃ²ng] the Song dynasty (960-1279); å®‹ä½“å­— Song typeface
From å®€ (miÃ¡n) 'roof' over æœ¨ (mÃ¹) 'wood'.

	There was also a å®‹ SÃ²ng dynasty in the years (420-479).

å¾ [zhÄ“ng] journey; é•¿å¾ Long March; attack; (Få¾µ) evidence; levy
From å½³ (chÃ¬) 'footstep' and æ­£ zhÃ¨ng phonetic.
	å¾ zhÄ“ng 'march' is an old character, not a modern simplification. There is another character å¾µ zhÄ“ng, but among simple form characters, å¾ is used for both å¾ and å¾µ. For example, å¾µå…µ 'to recruit troops' is written å¾å…µ in simple form characters (however, å¾µ is still used when pronounced zhÇ).
	Versions 1 and 2 of the Wenlin dictionary always used å¾µ as the full form of å¾, but this was incorrect. For example, é•¿å¾ is written é•·å¾ (not *é•·å¾µ) among full form characters.

å…ƒ [yuÃ¡n] primary; dollar
The top äºŒ is an old form of ä¸Š (shÃ ng) 'superior', the bottom is å„¿ (äºº rÃ©n) 'person'.
	"Probably etymologically the same word as åŸ" --Karlgren.
	Compare åŸ yuÃ¡n 'originally' and æº yuÃ¡n 'source'.
	The meaning 'dollar' may derive from åœ† yuÃ¡n 'round' (coin).

æŒ [chÃ­] hold; åšæŒ jiÄnchÃ­ persist; ä¿æŒ bÇochÃ­ keep
From æ‰Œ(æ‰‹ shÇ’u) 'hand' and å¯º sÃ¬ ('temple') phonetic.

From æ­£ zhÃ¨ng 'correct' and æ”µ(æ”´ pÅ«) 'strike, beat'.
	æ”¿ zhÃ¨ng is etymologically the same word as æ­£ zhÃ¨ng.

å±€ [jÃº] department; situation; é‚®å±€ yÃ³ujÃº post office
From å°¸ 'body' and å¥ jÃ¹ phonetic. Note that å¥ loses its first stroke when it becomes part of å±€.

æ´² [zhÅu] continent; äºšæ´² Asia; æ¬§æ´² Europe; éæ´² Africa
From æ°µ(æ°´ shuÇ) 'water' and å· zhÅu 'prefecture'.
	"Islet; continent -- etymologically the same word as å·; character tautologically enlarged by æ°´" --Karlgren.

ä¹˜ [chÃ©ng] ride (a vehicle); multiply   [shÃ¨ng] chariot
"Picture of a war chariot with a fence roof and åŒ— two men" --Karlgren.

å…¥ [rÃ¹] (è¿›å…¥ jÃ¬nrÃ¹) enter; æ”¶å…¥ shÅurÃ¹ income
Possibly roots entering the ground; or an arrow-head; or an upside-down V shaped entrance to a tent or hut. å…¥ is part of å†… nÃ¨i 'inside'.
	Eleventh of the 214 radicals.
	å…¥ rÃ¹ 'enter' and äºº rÃ©n 'person' are almost mirror images in their modern forms.

å‘½ [mÃ¬ng] (ç”Ÿå‘½) life; destiny; å‘½ä»¤ command; é©å‘½ revolution
Like ä»¤ lÃ¬ng (as in å‘½ä»¤ mÃ¬nglÃ¬ng 'command'); å‘½ mÃ¬ng has an added å£ kÇ’u 'mouth'.

è„‰(Fè„ˆ) [mÃ i] vein; pulse; å±±è„‰ mountain range  [mÃ²] è„‰è„‰ mÃ²mÃ² lovingly
From æœˆ(è‚‰ rÃ²u) 'flesh' and æ°¸ (yÇ’ng) 'forever'.
	"Veins and arteries, pulse -- æ°¸ continuous flow in è‚‰ the body" --Karlgren(1923).
	The full form è„ˆ has í¡€í²¢ (the right side of æ´¾ pÃ i) instead of æ°¸. Originally í¡€í²¢ was just æ°¸ yÇ’ng backwards. The two forms è„‰ and è„ˆ seem to be equally old.

æµ [liÃº] to flow; stream; ç”µæµ electric current; äº¤æµ to exchange  [liÅ«]
From æ°µ(æ°´ shuÇ) 'water' and ã¬ liÃº phonetic.
