Lesson 15 Words compiled by Michael Huynh

å¹³ [pÃ­ng] level, even; æ°´å¹³ shuÇpÃ­ng level; å’Œå¹³ hÃ©pÃ­ng peace
"Picture of a kind of balance" --Karlgren.

ç­‰ [dÄ›ng] equal; class; wait; et cetera (etc.)
From ç«¹ (zhÃº) 'bamboo' and å¯º sÃ¬ 'temple'.
	ç«¹ probably stands for ç«¹ç®€ zhÃºjiÇn, the bamboo strips which were used for writing on before the invention of paper. Hence, record keeping, order, classification; (belonging to the same class:) equal.
	å¯º sÃ¬ 'temple' is part of ç­‰ dÄ›ng due to an etymological accident. An ancient word sounded similar to å¯º sÃ¬, so it was written ç­‰, with ç«¹ signific and å¯º phonetic. That word disappeared, and the character ç­‰ was borrowed to represent a synonym, now pronounced dÄ›ng.
	The meaning of ç­‰ dÄ›ng has been extended from "class, rank" to "await one's turn, according to rank" (--Karlgren).

æ€€(Fæ‡·) [huÃ¡i] bosom; cherish; æ€€ç–‘ suspect; æ€€å¿µ cherish memory
From å¿„(å¿ƒ xÄ«n) 'heart' and è¤±, which is simplified to ä¸ (bÃ¹). The original character was è¤± (without å¿„):
	"Wieger aptly explains the middle part as eye-lashes let down over ç½’ the eye: to hide; hide in è¡£ the robe" --Karlgren.
	Note that è¡£ (yÄ«) 'clothing' is split into two parts, äº  above and the rest below. å¿„(å¿ƒ xÄ«n) 'heart' was added to emphasize the meaning: carry in the bosom, cherish. è¤± has been simplified to ä¸; compare å(å£) huÃ i 'bad'.

å­• [yÃ¹n] æ€€å­• pregnant; å—å­• conceive; é¿å­• contraception
From ä¹ƒ 'womb' and å­ 'child'.
	ä¹ƒ here represents the womb, or, like å‹¹ in åŒ… bÄo, is just äºº rÃ©n person, a pregnant woman, with a å­ baby inside.

è¾(Fè¾­) [cÃ­] take leave; diction, poetry, language
From í¡‘í´”, simplified to èˆŒ (shÃ© 'tongue'), and è¾› (xÄ«n) 'suffering'.
	í¡‘í´” was the old form of ä¹±(äº‚) luÃ n 'unravel, confusion'.
	'To äº‚ unravel a è¾› crime' --Karlgren.
	'To äº‚ rid oneself of an è¾› accusation, to clear one's self, to excuse one's self... çŠ¹åŸ‹è¾œä¹Ÿã€‚' --Wieger.
	When saying goodbye, it is humble, and therefore polite, to apologize for being such a nuisance, and to make lots of excuses for everything. Hence the extended meaning of flowery language.
	The component èˆŒ shÃ© 'tongue' might be re-interpreted as indicating the meaning 'words'. In fact, è¾ cÃ­ is etymologically the same word as è¯ cÃ­ 'word' (according to Karlgren), and è¯å…¸ cÃ­diÇn 'dictionary' can also be written è¾å…¸.

ä¸» [zhÇ”] lord, master; (ä¸»è¦ zhÇ”yÃ o) main; ä¸»ä¹‰ zhÇ”yÃ¬ -ism
Picture of a lamp with a flame on top, symbolizing a master. It happens to look like ç‹ wÃ¡ng 'king' with an added dot.

æŠ¤(Fè­·) [hÃ¹] (ä¿æŠ¤ bÇohÃ¹) guard, protect; æŠ¤å£« hÃ¹shi nurse
From æ‰Œ(æ‰‹ shÇ’u) 'hand' and æˆ· hÃ¹ ('door') phonetic.
	The full form è­· is completely different: from è¨€ (yÃ¡n) 'words' and è’¦ huÃ² phonetic.

ç¤¾ [shÃ¨] (ç¤¾ä¼š shÃ¨huÃ¬) society
From ç¤»(ç¤º shÃ¬) 'altar' and åœŸ (tÇ”) 'earth'.
	"Altar to the spirits of the land; sacrifice to the spirits of the land; tutelary deity, village, society -- the ç¤º religious rites for åœŸ the land" --Karlgren.

ç®¡ [guÇn] tube; (ç®¡ç† guÇnlÇ) manage; ä¸ç®¡ bÃ¹guÇn no matter
From ç«¹ (zhÃº) 'bamboo' and å®˜ guÄn ('official') phonetic.
	"Reed; pipe, flute; tube; duct; to direct, manage, arrange, rule" --Karlgren.

ä¸ˆ [zhÃ ng] (length:) 3 1/3 meters; ä¸ˆå¤« zhÃ ngfu husband
Originally å (shÃ­) 'ten' over åˆ (yÃ²u) 'hand', now contracted. å ten åˆ hand-lengths.
	Compare æ”¯ zhÄ« 'branch'.

èŒ(Fè·) [zhÃ­] duty; èŒå·¥ staff; èŒä¸š zhÃ­yÃ¨ occupation
Originally æˆ , from éŸ³ (yÄ«n) 'sound' and æˆˆ (gÄ“) 'weapon', the meaning was 'officer':
	"The man with æˆˆ a lance who éŸ³ commands" --Karlgren.
	To æˆ  was added è€³ (Ä›r) 'ear', since one who governs should also know how to listen. Extended meaning: office, profession, occupation.
	In the simple form èŒ, æˆ  is replace by åª zhÇ phonetic. In fact most of the simple form characters with åª as phonetic originally contained æˆ .

è§£ [jiÄ›] separate; explain  [XiÃ¨] (surname) [jiÃ¨] è§£é€
From è§’ (jiÇo) 'horn', åˆ€ (dÄo) 'knife', and ç‰› (niÃº) 'ox'.
	"Cleave with a åˆ€ knife the è§’ horn of ç‰› an ox" --Karlgren.

è–ª [xÄ«n] è–ªæ°´ salary
From è‰¹(è‰ cÇo) 'grass' and æ–°.

æ­§ [qÃ­] (of roads:) fork, branch; divergent; æ­§è§† discriminate
From æ­¢ 'stop' and æ”¯ zhÄ« phonetic.
	Etymologically the same word as å² qÃ­ "double peaked mountain".

éš(Féš¨) [suÃ­] follow; ï€™ Following; éšä¾¿ suÃ­biÃ n as you like
The full form éš¨ is from éš‹ suÃ­ phonetic and è¾¶(è¾µ chuÃ²) 'go'. Notice how è¾¶ is inserted between the two sides of éš‹.
	In the simple form éš, the right side of éš‹ has been reduced to æœ‰ (by omitting the three strokes å·¥ between í¡€í²‡ and æœˆ).

æ–­(Fæ–·) [duÃ n] cut off; ä¸æ–­ bÃºduÃ n unceasing; åˆ¤æ–­ pÃ nduÃ n judge
The left side î¿(ã¡­) is the old form of ç»§(ç¹¼) jÃ¬ 'continue'; it represents lots of silk threads. æ–¤ (jÄ«n) 'axe' severs the connection.

åŠ¡(Få‹™) [wÃ¹] ä»»åŠ¡ rÃ¨nwu task; æœåŠ¡ fÃºwÃ¹ service
Originally çŸ› (mÃ¡o) 'spear', æ”µ(æ”´ pÅ«) 'beat', and åŠ› (lÃ¬) 'strength', meaning to apply one's force. An old form æ•„, without åŠ›, survives in å©ºç€è¥éªéª›é¹œ.
	æ”µ was reduced by one stroke to å¤‚, giving the modern full form å‹™. çŸ› was deleted, giving the modern simple form åŠ¡.

æˆš [qÄ«] äº²æˆš qÄ«nqÄ« relative; ä¼‘æˆš xiÅ«-qÄ« joy and sorrow
From æˆŠ (wÃ¹) 'battle-axe' and å°— shÅ« phonetic.
	"Battle axe; suffering, distress; pity, commiseration, sympathy; kin, relatives" --Karlgren.

æ¨¡ [mÃ³] æ¨¡èŒƒ model; æ¨¡ä»¿ imitate  [mÃº] æ¨¡æ · appearance; æ¨¡å­
From æœ¨ (mÃ¹) 'wood' and è« mÃ² phonetic.

èŒƒ [fÃ n] (surname); (Fç¯„) èŒƒå›´ scope, range; æ¨¡èŒƒ model, fine example
From è‰¹(è‰ cÇo) 'grass' over æ°¾ fÃ n phonetic.
	èŒƒ is an old character, used among full form characters only as a surname. èŒƒ is also used as the simple form of ç¯„ fÃ n, which is composed of ç«¹ (zhÃº) 'bamboo' over è»Š (chÄ“) 'car' and ã”¾ (a phonetic component).
	Compare çŠ¯ fÃ n 'criminal'.

è´´(Fè²¼) [tiÄ“] stick, paste, glue; stay close to
From è´(è² bÃ¨i) 'cowry shell' and å  zhÄn phonetic.
	It's surprising that å  zhÄn is phonetic in è´´ tiÄ“; the ancient pronunciations were approximately *tsiam and *tiep, respectively, according to Karlgren(1923).
	Compare å¸–, with which è´´(è²¼) is often interchanged. According to modern standards, è´´(è²¼) is only pronounced in the first tone.

é¼  [shÇ”] (è€é¼  lÇoshÇ”) mouse, rat; é¼ å¹´ Year of Rat (1st year)
"Rat, rodents in general; ç©´è™«ä¹‹æ€»åä¹Ÿã€‚è±¡å½¢ã€‚The head, the stiff whiskers, and the tail. The ancient character represented the animal" --Wieger.

çŒ«(Fè²“) [mÄo] cat; ç†ŠçŒ« panda; çŒ«å¤´é¹° owl   [mÃ¡o] çŒ«è…°
From çŠ­(è±¸ zhÃ¬) beast' and è‹— miÃ¡o phonetic.

æ¦‚ [gÃ i] å¤§æ¦‚ roughly, most likely; æ¦‚å¿µ concept; æ°”æ¦‚ spirit
From æœ¨ (mÃ¹) 'wood' and æ—¢ jÃ¬ (since, already) phonetic.

è½»(Fè¼•) [qÄ«ng] light (cf é‡ heavy)
From è½¦(è»Š chÄ“) 'car' and î¿—(å· ) jÄ«ng phonetic.
	"Light carriage" --Karlgren.

å« [jiÃ ] (of a woman:) marry
From å¥³ (nÇš) 'woman' and å®¶ jiÄ 'home'.

å§» [yÄ«n] marriage; å©šå§» hÅ«nyÄ«n marriage; in-law
From å¥³ (nÇš) 'woman' and å›  yÄ«n phonetic.

è…¹ [fÃ¹] belly, stomach, abdomen; è…¹åœ° hinterland
From æœˆ(è‚‰ rÃ²u) 'flesh' and å¤ fÃ¹ phonetic.

ç”š [shÃ¨n] very; ç”šè‡³ shÃ¨nzhÃ¬ even, go so far as to [shÃ©n] (=ä»€)
"...Affection ç”˜ for the being åŒ¹ that makes the pair (sexual)... This affection being very great, says, the Glose, hence the extended meaning, superlative, very, extremely, excessive... ä»ç”˜ä»åŒ¹ã€‚åŒ¹å¶ä¹Ÿã€‚ä¼šæ„ã€‚å®‰ä¹ä¹Ÿã€‚ç”·å¥³ä¹‹å¤§æ¬²å­˜ç„‰ã€‚" --Wieger.
	The resemblence to å…¶ qÃ­ is coincidental.
	ç”š is often used among full form characters for ä»€ shÃ©n, as in ä»€ä¹ˆ(ä»€éº½ or ç”šéº½) shÃ©nme 'what'.

å˜(Fè®Š) [biÃ n] change; å˜æˆ become; å˜åŒ– variation; æ”¹å˜ alter
From î¿‹(äœŒ) luÃ¡n phonetic, and åˆ (yÃ²u) 'hand'. In the full form the top äœŒ is composed of è¨€ words surrounded by two ç³¸ threads, and the bottom is æ”µ(æ”´ pÅ«) 'beat' (often written å¤‚), not just åˆ.
	How can î¿‹ luÃ¡n be phonetic in å˜ biÃ n? "There was an Archaic labial + l (pl-, bl-, ml-) somewhere in this group" --Karlgren(1923).
	Compare æŒ›å­ª luÃ¡n, æ‹ liÃ n, è›® mÃ¡n, å¼¯ wÄn.

å¸‚ [shÃ¬] (å¸‚åœº shÃ¬chÇng) market; (åŸå¸‚ chÃ©ngshÃ¬) city, town
The explanations are all very obscure.
	Five strokes: the top ä¸¶ dot is a seperate stroke; distinguish å¸‚ from the component å·¿ (as in è‚º fÃ¨i 'lungs') which is only four strokes.

é…¬ [chÃ³u] é…¬è°¢ chÃ³uxiÃ¨ thank with a gift; æŠ¥é…¬ bÃ ochou reward
From é…‰ (yÇ’u) 'wine' and å· zhÅu phonetic.
	The primary meaning is "propose a toast".

æ”¹ [gÇi] (æ”¹å˜ gÇibiÃ n) change; æ”¹é© gÇigÃ© reform
From å·± jÇ phonetic and æ”µ(æ”´ pÅ«) 'beat' signific. The bottom of å·± is changed from ä¹š to í¡€í´Œ.

é© [gÃ©] leather; é©å‘½ gÃ©mÃ¬ng revolution; æ”¹é© reform; ï€‘  [jÃ­] ç—…é©
"Hide, skin; to flay, take off; deprive of -- picture of a skin split open, a hide seen from the back, with legs apart" --Karlgren.
	The extended meaning of 'revolution' may refer to the way a rejected leader has his leadership stripped away like a dead sheep's hide.

å‡ [shÄ“ng] liter; rise, ascend; ï€§ Pushing Upward
The primary meaning is 'liter', one tenth of a æ–— dÇ’u. Like æ–—, å‡ depicted some kind of a measuring cup or ladle.
	The character å‡ was also borrowed for the word shÄ“ng 'rise', which happens to sound the same. (Variant forms for shÄ“ng 'rise' are æ˜‡ and é™.)

æ•°(Fæ•¸) [shÃ¹] number; æ•°å­¦ math  [shÇ”] count  [shuÃ²]
The componentæ”µ(æ”´ pÅ«) 'beat' makes sense for clapping, tapping rythmically to facilitate in counting. The significance of å¨„(å©) lÃ³u 'go bad' is obscure.

æ˜¾(Fé¡¯) [xiÇn] appear; æ˜¾ç„¶ xiÇnrÃ¡n obvious
The old form ã¬ derived from æ—¥ (rÃ¬) 'sun' shining over çµ² (sÄ«) 'silk threads' (but with only four dots at the bottom). The full form é¡¯ has é  (yÃ¨) 'head' added. In the simple form æ˜¾ the bottom is abbreviated to ä¸š (yÃ¨).

å‡(Fæ¸›) [jiÇn] subtract; å‡å°‘ jiÇnshÇo decrease
From å†« or æ°µ(æ°´ shuÇ) 'water' and å’¸ xiÃ¡n (salty) phonetic.

é¡¾(Fé¡§) [gÃ¹] (ç…§é¡¾ zhÃ ogu) look after; é¡¾å®¢ gÃ¹kÃ¨ customer
From é›‡ gÃ¹ (hire, employ) phonetic and é¡µ(é  yÃ¨) 'head'. In the simple form é¡¾, é›‡ is replaced by å„ (Ã¨ 'disaster').

å¦» [qÄ«] (å¦»å­ qÄ«zi) wife
From î¿­ 'hand' and å¥³ (nÇš) 'woman'.
	"The å¥³ woman who in her î¿­ hand holds a broom, cf. å¦‡" --Karlgren.

æœ [chÃ¡o] towards; dynasty; æœé²œ ChÃ¡oxiÄn Korea  [zhÄo] (morning)
The left side í¡‚í¶ depicts the æ—¥ (rÃ¬) sun rising between the plants. The right side was not originally æœˆ (yuÃ¨) 'moon'; its origin is obscure (the seal character had èˆŸ zhÅu phonetic; older forms had something else).
	"Dawn, morning; ...morning ceremony, imperial audience, go to an audience; court; dynasty" --Karlgren.
	æœ zhÄo 'morning' is cognate to æ½® chÃ¡o 'morning tide'.
	Compare ä¹¾ qiÃ¡n 'creative'.
