åº­ [tÃ­ng] å®¶åº­ jiÄtÃ­ng family; æ³•åº­ court; åº­é™¢ courtyard
From å¹¿ 'house' and å»· tÃ­ng 'royal court'.

From è´(è² bÃ¨i) 'money' and å…¼ jiÄn phonetic.

é“(Féµ) [tiÄ›] iron (Fe)
From é’…(é‡‘) 'metal' and å¤± shÄ« phonetic.
	The standard full form is éµ (of obscure etymology). Another (now non-standard) form is é‰„, in which å¤± shÄ« is phonetic. é‰„ was used as the basis of the modern simple form é“.

ç¢— [wÇn] bowl
From çŸ³ (shÃ­) 'stone' and å®› wÇn (just like, as if) phonetic.

æŠ€ [jÃ¬] æŠ€æœ¯ technology, technique; ç§‘æŠ€ science & technology
From æ‰Œ(æ‰‹ shÇ’u) 'hand' and æ”¯ zhÄ« (branch, support) phonetic.

æœ¯(Fè¡“) [shÃ¹] skill; (è‰ºæœ¯ yÃ¬shÃ¹) art; æŠ€æœ¯ technique  [zhÃº]
The simple form æœ¯ depicts a kind of grain. (The original meaning is now written ç§« shÃº, with ç¦¾ hÃ© 'grain' added.)
	The full form è¡“ contains æœ¯ phonetic and è¡Œ (xÃ­ng) 'conduct'.
	The use of æœ¯ as the modern simple form resulted by omitting è¡Œ.

ç‹¬(Fç¨) [dÃº] only, alone; ç‹¬ç«‹ dÃºlÃ¬ independent
From çŠ­(çŠ¬ quÇn) 'dog' and èœ€ shÇ” ('silkworm') phonetic, simplified to è™« (chÃ³ng 'worm').
	Why is çŠ­(çŠ¬ quÇn) 'dog' a component in ç‹¬ 'alone'? ShuÅwÃ©n says: "ç¾Šçˆ²ç¾¤, çŠ¬çˆ²ç¨ YÃ¡ng wÃ©i qÃºn, quÇn wÃ©i dÃº." Maybe this refers to a lone sheep dog guarding a ç¾¤ qÃºn herd of sheep.

The modern character is composed of è‰® (gÃ¨n â˜¶) and è¾¶(è¾µ chuÃ²) 'go'. However, the part that is now written è‰® was originally æ—¥ (rÃ¬) 'sun' over å¤‚ (zhÇ) 'walk slowly' (a foot pointing downwards).
	"å¤‚ walk with difficulty in the æ—¥ sunshine, è¾¶ a tautological addition; retire from the day; has nothing to do with è‰®" --Karlgren.

å†² [chÅng] (Fæ²–) rinse; rush; (Fè¡) rush  [chÃ²ng] (Fè¡) towards
å†² is composed of å†«(æ°´ shuÇ) 'water' and ä¸­ zhÅng phonetic.
	The form æ²–, with æ°µ three-dot water instead of å†« two-dot water, is more common among full form characters. But å†² with two dots is very old, it occurs in è€å­ LÇozÇ.
	Another character è¡ is used among full form characters for chÃ²ng 'towards' and sometimes for chÅng 'rush' when the meaning doesn't involve water. è¡ is composed of è¡Œ (xÃ­ng) 'walk' and é‡ zhÃ²ng phonetic.
	å†²(è¡) chÃ²ng (fourth tone) also means 'mechanical punch'. Otherwise, in multisyllabic words å†² is always pronounced chÅng (first tone).
	Summary: there are two full forms, æ²– and è¡ (sometimes interchangeable); there is only one simple form: å†².
