Lesson 1 Words compiled by Michael Huynh

结(F結) [jié] tie; 结果 jiéguǒ result; 结婚 marry  [jiē] bear fruit
From 纟(糸 sī) 'thread' and 吉 jí ('good luck') phonetic.

束 [shù] bundle; 束缚 shùfù tie up; 结束 jiéshù finish
木 (mù) plants (or wood) 口 tied up in a bundle.
	Don't confuse 束 with the component 朿, as in 刺 cì.

注 [zhù] pour; (F註) notes; 注意 zhùyì pay attention; 注视 gaze
From 氵(水 shuǐ) 'water' and 主 zhǔ phonetic.
	"To flow (as water); conduct water in a certain direction; fix one's attention or mind on; apply" --Karlgren.
	Another character, 註, from 言 (yán) 'words' and 主 zhǔ, represented a different word zhù.
	"To comment on, explain, commentary; annotate, make a note of, set forth, narrate; to sign, endorse" --Karlgren.
	The meanings 'pay attention' and 'make a note' happening to be similar, 注 came to be used in place of 註. Among simple form characters only 注 occurs. Among full form characters, 註 still sometimes occurs in 註釋(注释) zhùshì 'explain', but 注 is used in 注音 zhùyīn 'phonetic notation'.

册(F冊) [cè] book; 手册 shǒucè handbook; 地图册 dìtúcè atlas
"Writing tablet; a list, document, records; diploma -- picture of wooden writing slips tied together" --Karlgren.

续(F續) [xù] (继续 jìxù) continue; 连续 liánxù continuous
纟(糸 sī) 'silk thread' indicates the meaning of connection, continuity. The right side is not historically derived from 卖(賣) mài 'sell', but from an obsolete character pronounced yù (圥 over 罒 over 貝, which came to be written the same as 賣). It was a phonetic component in 续, and also in 读(讀) dú 'read', 赎(贖) shú 'redeem', etc.

祖 [zǔ] (祖先 zǔxiān) ancestor; 祖母 zǔmǔ grandmother
From 礻(示 shì) 'altar' and 且 qiě phonetic.
	The 示 altar is used for making sacrifices to the ancestors.

籍 [jí] book; registry; native place; membership; 国籍 nationality
From 竹 (zhú) 'bamboo' and 耤 jí phonetic.
	The bottom 耤 jí 'sacred imperial field' (from 耒 'plough' and 昔 xī) is a rare character which is phonetic in both 籍 jí and 藉 jí.

全 [quán] whole, entire; 完全 completely; 安全 safety
One theory is that 全 comes from  ( = 集 jí 'gather'), over 工 gōng 'work': the  whole 工 works. The vertical 丨 stroke of 工 is extended upward to join the horizontal stroke of . Or it could be that the bottom was 玉 yù, a perfect piece of jade. There might also be some relation to 合 hé, and 仝(同 tóng) 'together'.

省 [shěng] province; economize; omit  [xǐng] 反省 introspection
From 少 (shǎo) 'little' over 目 (mù) 'eye'. To 目 watch carefully, to use 少 little, economize.

处(F處) [chù] place  [chǔ] deal with
Originally 処, from 夂 (zhǐ) 'walk slowly' and 几 (jī) 'small table':
	"Where you 夂 go and 几 sit down" --Karlgren.
	Somebody put 虍(虎 hǔ) 'tiger' on top of it all for no known reason, making the full form 處. In the simple form the 几 chair was discarded, along with all of the 虍 tiger except its 卜... head?

适(F適) [shì] 合适 héshì suitable, appropriate   [dí]
From 啇 dī phonetic and 辶(辵 chuò) 'go'.
	啇 is abbreviated to 舌 (shé 'tongue') in the simple form, compare 敌(敵) dí.

应(F應) [yīng] (应该 yīnggāi) should  [yìng] 应用 apply
The full form 應 is composed of 鷹 yīng ('eagle') phonetic (minus 鳥) and 心 (xīn) 'heart' signific. The simple form 应 has 倠 and 心 replaced by a four-stroke rough outline.

靠 [kào] lean on; rely on; keep close to; come up to; near
From 告 gào phonetic over 非 (fēi) 'wrong'.
	The role of 非 in 靠 is not clear.

波 [bō] (波浪 bōlàng) wave; 波长 wavelength
From 氵(水 shǔi) 'water' and 皮 pí phonetic. 皮 'skin' also suggests the meaning of 波 'wave', since waves are seen on the surface, or skin, of water.

士 [shì] scholar; 博士 Ph.D; 女士 lady, Ms.; 战士 soldier
十 shí 'ten' over 一 yī 'one'.
	"Officer (military or civil); scholar, gentleman" --Karlgren(1923).
	Compare 土 tǔ 'earth'; in 士 shì, the bottom line is shorter.
	The explanation that 士 comes from 十 'ten' and 一 'one' dates back at least to 说文 Shuōwén, written in 100 A.D.
	Some modern scholars believe 士 was originally a phallic symbol (--Henshall).
	In Japanese, 士 is the character for 'samurai'.

顿(F頓) [dùn] to pause; meal
From 屯 tún phonetic and 页(頁 yè) 'head'.
	"Bow the head, prostrate; throw down; downstroke, a pause, a period, a time, a meal.." --Karlgren.

柯 [kē] (书) stalk, branch; (surname)
From 木 (mù) 'tree' and 可 kě.
