Lesson 12 Words compiled by Michael Huynh

晨 [chén] (早晨 zǎochen) morning
From 日 (rì) 'sun' and 辰 chén, which is the name of the two-hour period between 7 and 9 in the morning.
	晨 chén is etymologically the same word as 辰 chén, written with 日 'sun' added for emphasis.

荷 [hé] lotus; 荷花 lotus flower  [hè] carry; load
From 艹(草 cǎo) 'grass' and 何 hé phonetic.

戴 [dài] put on; 戴眼镜; 戴上帽子
From 𢦏 zái phonetic and 異, which is the full form of 异(異) yì 'different': 田 over 共. You become different when you put on a hat or glasses.

俗 [sú] common, rustic, vulgar; custom; 俗话 proverb, saying
From 亻(人 rén) 'person' and 谷 gǔ 'valley'.
	"Was 谷 phonetic in spite of the initial, or is the meaning: a 人 man from 谷 the mountains, a rustic?" --Karlgren.

惯(F慣) [guàn] be used to; 习惯 xíguàn be used to; habit; custom
From 忄(心 xīn) 'heart' and 贯(貫) guàn. The top of 贯 depicts a coin with a string through a hole in its middle, to convey the meaning 'penetrate' (贯穿 guànchuān).
	"Know thoroughly, familiar with, used to, practised in" --Karlgren.

丰 [fēng] good-looking  (F豐)  Abundance; 丰富 fēngfù abundant
The form on the far left, four strokes, is the oldest:
	"Picture of a blossom, a bouquet" --Karlgren.
	"Some philologists say that this character is 生, that strikes down its tap root; 从生上下达, 指事。The study of the compounds makes this opinion improbable. 丰 is a primitive, representing a leafy bough." --Wieger.
	It was doubled (second form from right), then various things were added; the full form 豐 has 丰 doubled over 山 and 豆. However, for the meaning "good-looking", the simple form 丰 is used even among full form characters.
	The simple form 丰 is the same as the oldest form, except that the top line is straightened out.

盛 ²shèng s.v. ①flourishing; prosperous ②vigorous; energetic
From 成 chéng ('complete') phonetic and 皿 (mǐn) 'bowl'.

鸡(F雞) [jī] chicken; 宫保鸡丁 Kung Pao Chicken
The full form 雞 is composed of 奚 xī phonetic and 隹 (zhuī) 'bird'.
	In the simple form 鸡, the left side is abbreviated to 又 (yòu), and the right side is 鸟(鳥 niǎo) 'bird'.
	A variant form is 鷄.

鸭(F鴨) [yā] (鸭子 yāzi) duck; 唐老鸭 Donald Duck
From 甲 jiǎ phonetic and 鸟(鳥 niǎo) 'bird'.
	Not to be confused with 鸦 as in 乌鸦 wūyā.

根 [gēn] root; 根本 gēnběn foundation; (not) at all
From 木 (mù) 'tree' and 艮 gèn phonetic.

端 [duān] hold sth. level with both hands; extremity, end
From 立 (lì) 'stand' and 耑 duān, which is 山 (shān) over 而 (ér).
	"Etymologically same word as 耑... a 屮 plant growing up from the 一 earth and having roots below, picture; has nothing to do with 山 and 而"
--Karlgren.

粽 [zòng] (粽子) delicious 糯米 wrapped in leaves.
From 米 'rice' and 宗 zōng.

表 [biǎo] show; list, table; (F錶) (wrist-)watch
Originally from 衣 (yī) 'clothing' and 毛 (máo) 'hair', now written  (four strokes) over  (also four strokes).
	"The outside of a garment, outside, external; (outsiders:) relatives of a different family name; (the side that is seen:) conspicuous, to manifest; a signal; a watch, thermometer etc; schedule -- the 毛 hairy side of 衣 the (fur) garment" --Karlgren.
	For the meaning 'watch' (as in 'wrist-watch'), the variant form 錶 (with 金 jīn 'metal' added) is sometimes used (but not among simple form characters).

际(F際) [jì] (边际 biānjì) boundary; 实际 reality; 国际 international

	祭 is abbreviated to 示 shì in the simple form 际.

忧(F憂) [yōu] worry; grieve; 忧郁 yōuyù sad; 忧虑 worry about
"Melancholy, sad; grief, mourning; anxious -- the seal has 𦣻 head, 心 heart, and 夂 walk slowly" --Karlgren(1923).
	The simple form 忧 is composed of 忄(心 xīn) 'heart' and 尤 yóu (fault, outstanding) phonetic.
	Note that in the full form 憂, the bottom stroke of 𦣻 has been replaced by 冖; the total stroke count is 15, not 16.

投 [tóu] throw; 投票 tóupiào vote
From 扌(手 shǒu) 'hand' and 殳 shū phonetic. 殳 is a 又 hand making a jerky motion, so it also suggests the meaning 'throw'.
	Don't confuse 投 tóu with 设 shè 'set up', which has 讠(言 yán) 'words' instead of 扌.

江 [jiāng] river; 长江 Yang-tse; 江山 landscape
From 氵(水 shuǐ) 'water' and 工 gōng phonetic.

精 [jīng] perfect; 精神 spirit, essence; 酒精 alcohol
From 米 (mǐ) 'rice' and 青 qīng phonetic.
	Why 米 rice? Because rice is PERFECT every time. Rice is the ESSENCE of Chinese food, and is used to make ALCOHOL (酒精).

From 礻(示 shì) 'altar' and 申 shēn phonetic.
	"Spirit, spiritual; god; soul, mind, intelligence; vitality, force" --Karlgren.

From 竹 (zhú) 'bamboo' and 同 tóng phonetic.

龙(F龍) [lóng] dragon; 恐龙 kǒnglóng dinosaur
"The dragon. When it ascends to heaven and flies, it rains; when it hides in the wells, there is a drought. Vapors and clouds personified." --Wieger.
	Don't confuse the simple form 龙 with 尤 yóu (as in 尤其 yóuqí 'especially').

征 [zhēng] journey; 长征 Long March; attack; (F徵) evidence; levy
From 彳 (chì) 'footstep' and 正 zhèng phonetic.
	征 zhēng 'march' is an old character, not a modern simplification. There is another character 徵 zhēng, but among simple form characters, 征 is used for both 征 and 徵. For example, 徵兵 'to recruit troops' is written 征兵 in simple form characters (however, 徵 is still used when pronounced zhǐ).
	Versions 1 and 2 of the Wenlin dictionary always used 徵 as the full form of 征, but this was incorrect. For example, 长征 is written 長征 (not *長徵) among full form characters.

恐 [kǒng] (恐怕 kǒngpà) I'm afraid; 恐怖 kǒngbù terror
From 巩 gǒng phonetic and 心 (xīn) 'heart'.

The full form 壓 is 厭 yàn phonetic over 土 (tǔ) 'earth' signific.

农(F農) [nóng] (农民 nóngmín) farmer, peasant; 农业 agriculture
"The husbandman; 耕人也。A 囟 head, two  hands, and 晨 the break of day contracted, 日 giving place to 囟. The man who works from early dawn; all field-work being done very early in hot countries 耕作必于晨" --Wieger.
 	Don't confuse the simple form 农 with 衣 yī 'clothing'.

From 宀 (mián) 'roof' and 肖 xiāo (portrait) phonetic.

From 火 (huǒ) 'fire' and 丁 dīng phonetic. In the full form 燈, the phonetic part is 登 dēng.

圆(F圓) [yuán] round; circle; (sometimes used for 元 dollar)
From 囗 (wéi) 'surround' and 员(員) yuán.

团(F團) [tuán] ball, lump; group; 团结 unite
From 囗 (wéi) 'circle' and 專 zhuān phonetic.

尽 [jìn] (F盡) use up  [jǐn] (F儘) to max extent; 尽管 even though
The simple form 尽 is drastically abbreviated. The top of 盡 contains a derivative of 聿 (yù), now obsolete, which is also phonetic in 津 jīn. The four dots 灬 are 火 huǒ 'fire', and the bottom is 皿 mǐn 'bowl', or in this case, a brazier in which the fire burns. The primitive meaning was 'ashes', which is now written 烬(燼) jìn, with the addition of another 火.
	"By extension, ended, finished (the ashes being the final result of the combustion), an action that went to its term, consummation, exhaustion" --Wieger.
Two full forms 盡 jìn and 儘 jǐn are distinguished, 儘 with the addition of 亻(人 rén) being used when the pronounciation is jǐn. Jìn and jǐn are cognate words. There is only one simple form 尽.

院 [yuàn] courtyard; 学院 college; 医院 hospital; 法院 court
From 阝(阜 fù) 'hill' and 完 wán phonetic.

饼(F餅) [bǐng] cake; 饼干 cracker, cookie

--Karlgren.

楚 [chu] 清楚 qīngchu clear   [chǔ] 苦楚 kǔchǔ misery
From 林 (lín) 'forest' and 疋 shū phonetic.
	"Dense bushes, thorns; (dense:) rich, detailed; distinct, clear; (thorny:) sharp, painful" --Karlgren.
	疋 shū is a picture of a foot, like 止 and 足. Note the 乛 hook, 疋 is not  as in 是, 定, or 走.
	楚 chǔ nearly always comes at the end of words rather than the beginning. Mostly it occurs in the word 清楚 qīngchu 'clear'.

屈 [qū] bend; submit; injustice; 屈服 yield; 委屈 feel wronged
"尸 is 尾 wěi tail contracted. To 出 go away, the 尾 tail lowered" --Wieger.
	"尾 the tail when (the dog) 出 goes out -- bent!; or is 出 phonetic in spite of the initial?" --Karlgren(1923).
	屈 is not the same word, etymologically, as 曲 qū, though both 屈 and 曲 are used as verbs meaning 'bend'. In Cantonese, 屈 and 曲 have very different pronunciations.
