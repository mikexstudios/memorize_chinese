Lesson 17 Words compiled by Michael Huynh

松 [sōng] pine tree; 松鼠 squirrel; (F鬆) loose
From 木 (mù) 'tree' and 公 gōng phonetic; Karlgren speculates an Archaic *ks- or *gz-.
	The second meaning 'dishevelled; slack, lax, loose; free, careless', in the full form is written 鬆, with 髟 (biāo) 'long hair' signific on top of 松 sōng phonetic. The simple form for both meanings is 松.

填 [tián] fill, stuff; fill in (form)
From 土 (tǔ) 'dirt' and 真 zhēn phonetic.

式 [shì] (形式) form; 方式 way, pattern; 正式 formal, official
From 工 (gōng) 'work' and 弋 yì (arrow with string) phonetic.
	"Pattern, shape; fashion, sort; rule, law; imitate" --Karlgren.

熟 [shú] cooked, ripe, familiar; 熟悉 shúxī know well  [shóu]
Originally written 孰, which is 丸() a hand offering up a 享 (xiǎng) 'feast'. 灬(火 huǒ) 'fire' was added later. Compare 热(熱) rè 'hot'.
	The pronunciation shóu commonly occurs with the same meanings and uses as shú.

观(F觀) [guān] view;  Contemplation    [guàn] 道观 temple
The full form 觀 is composed of 雚 guàn phonetic and 見(见) jiàn 'see'. In the simple form 观, 雚 is abbreviated to 又, just as in 欢(歡) huān 'happy'.

何 [hé] what; 任何 rènhé any; 如何 rúhé how; 几何 jǐhé geometry
From 亻(人 rén) 'person' and 可 kě phonetic.
	Aside from the common words 任何 rènhé 'any' and 几何 jǐhé 'geometry', 何 hé occurs more often in books than in spoken conversation, where 什么 shénme 'what' and 怎么 zěnme 'how' sound more natural than 何 hé and 如何 rúhé.

基 [jī] 基础 jīchǔ foundation; 基本 jīběn basic
From 土 (tǔ) 'ground' and 其 qí (its, other, especially) phonetic.

础(F礎) [chǔ] 基础 jīchǔ foundation, base, basis; 础石 chǔshí plinth
From 石 (shí) 'stone' and 出 chū phonetic (in the full form 礎, the phonetic part is 楚 chǔ).
	础石 chǔshí means 'plinth'; a plinth is a stone block base in classical architecture. The only important common word that contains 础 is 基础 jīchǔ.

领(F領) [lǐng] to lead; collar; 领导, 领袖 leader; 本领 ability
From 令 lìng phonetic and 页(頁 yè) 'head'.
	"Neck; collar; (pull by the neck:) to lead, to direct; chief; (place on the neck, take upon oneself:) receive" --Karlgren.

将(F將) [jiāng] shall; 将来 future   [jiàng] general; (chess piece)  [qiāng]
"From: 寸 (hand in the 'thumb' var:) to offer 月(肉) meat, signific and 爿 qiáng phonetic" --Karlgren.
	As a phonetic component, in simple form characters 将 is abbreviated to  as in 浆奖桨浆酱 etc.

竞(F競) [jìng] 竞争 jìngzhēng compete; 竞赛 contest
Originally 誩, 言 (yán) 'words' doubled, then two 儿 people 言 arguing, disputing, competing. The modern full form is 競, and the simple form is 竞.
	Compare 竟 jìng 'finish', the top of which is from 音 yīn.

辩(F辯) [biàn] (辩论 biànlùn) debate, argue; 辩证 diagnosis
Originally 辡, from 辛 (xīn) doubled.
	"Two 辛 criminals against each other" --Karlgren(1923).
	讠(言) yán 'words' was added later. 辩 is etymologically the same word as 辨 biàn 'discriminate', which has 刂(刀 dāo) 'knife' instead of 言.
	Compare 狱 yù.

批 [pī] (量) batch, lot, group; slap; 批评 pīpíng criticize
From 扌(手 shǒu) 'hand' and 比 bǐ phonetic.

评(F評) [píng] criticize
From 讠(言 yán) 'words' and 平 píng 'level'. Etymologically 评 is the same word as 平 (picture of a balance):
	Weigh --> appreciate --> criticize.

态(F態) [tài] form; 态度 tàidu manner; 状态 zhuàngtài state
From 太 tài phonetic over 心 (xīn) 'heart'. The full form 態 has 能 néng on top, instead of 太 (the reason is obscure).

害 [hài] harmful; 害虫 hàichóng destructive insect; 厉害 lìhai fierce
The top is 宀 (mián) 'roof' and the bottom is 口 (kǒu) 'mouth'. The middle looks like 丰 (fēng) in the modern character. The explanation is obscure (see the picture in 汉语大字典; the bottom looks like 古 gǔ).
	害 hài is phonetic in 割 gē 'cut'.

确(F確) [què] true; 正确 correct; 确实 indeed; 明确 explicit
石 (shí) 'stone' indicates the meaning: solid, firm, certain.
	In the full form 確 the phonetic part is 隺 hè. In the simple form 确 the phonetic part is 角 jiǎo.

缺 [quē] (缺乏quēfá) lack, be short of; 缺点 quēdiǎn shortcoming
From 缶 (fǒu) 'dish' and 夬 guài ('break-through') phonetic.

压(F壓) [yā] press; pressure    [yà]
The full form 壓 is 厭 yàn phonetic over 土 (tǔ) 'earth' signific.

承 [chéng] 承认 chéngrèn admit; 继承 jìchéng inherit
From 卩 an object, 廾 =  two hands, and 手 another hand: something being handed over. Compare 丞 chéng.

督 [dū] 监督 jiāndū supervise
From 叔 shū ('uncle') phonetic over 目 (mù) 'eye'.

促 [cù] urge; urgent; 促进 cùjìn promote; 促使 cùshǐ impel, urge
From 亻(人 rén) 'person' and 足 zú ('foot') phonetic.

视(F視) [shì] look; regard; look at/upon; 电视 diànshì T.V.
From 礻(示) shì phonetic and 见(見 jiàn) 'see'.

发 [fā] (F發) emit  [fà] (F髮) hair  [fa] (F髮) 头发 hair
The full form 發 is 癶 bò phonetic over 弓殳: to 殳 (shū) launch arrows with a 弓 (gōng) bow. (癶 also suggests the meaning: two 止 feet, "separation, divergence, letting loose" --Wieger). An old form had 矢 shǐ 'arrow' instead of 殳. 发 fà 'hair' has a different origin. The full form 髮 is 髟 biāo 'hair' (長 long 彡 hair) on top of 犮 (the right side of 拔 bá) phonetic (which is unrelated to 发). The similarity between 拔 and 发 is coincidental. Anyway, there is a single simple form: 发 fā 'emit', fà 'hair'.

挥(F揮) [huī] wave, wield; command an army; 挥手 wave (one's hand)
From 扌(手 shǒu) 'hand' and 军(軍) jūn 'army'.
	Compare 辉 huī (光辉 'brilliance'). Why these both contain 军 jūn is "phonetically very curious" --Karlgren.

淘 [táo] wash, clean; 淘气 táoqì naughty; 淘汰 eliminate
From 氵(水 shuǐ) 'water' and 匋 táo phonetic.

汰 [tài] wash out, clean
From 氵(水 shuǐ) 'water' and 太 tài phonetic.

端 [duān] hold sth. level with both hands; extremity, end
From 立 (lì) 'stand' and 耑 duān, which is 山 (shān) over 而 (ér).
	"Etymologically same word as 耑... a 屮 plant growing up from the 一 earth and having roots below, picture; has nothing to do with 山 and 而"
--Karlgren.

求 [qiú] seek, ask; 要求 yāoqiú demand; requirement
Picture of fur. Originally 求 qiú meant 'fur coat'; it was borrowed for the abstract word 'seek' (the character 裘 qiú was then created for the meaning 'fur coat').
	(The seal form appears to contain (又) yòu 'hand'. Karlgren believes  yòu was phonetic in 求 qiú.)

使 [shǐ] make, cause to
From 亻(人 rén) 'person' and 吏 lì phonetic.
	吏 lì (as in 官吏 guānlì 'government official') is 史 shǐ (as in 历史 lìshǐ 'history'), with an extra 一 horizontal stroke. In spite of the initial l-, 吏 lì is phonetically related to 史 shǐ and 使 shǐ, and also to 事 shì 'event'.

变(F變) [biàn] change; 变成 become; 变化 variation; 改变 alter
From (䜌) luán phonetic, and 又 (yòu) 'hand'. In the full form the top 䜌 is composed of 言 words surrounded by two 糸 threads, and the bottom is 攵(攴 pū) 'beat' (often written 夂), not just 又.
	How can  luán be phonetic in 变 biàn? "There was an Archaic labial + l (pl-, bl-, ml-) somewhere in this group" --Karlgren(1923).
	Compare 挛孪 luán, 恋 liàn, 蛮 mán, 弯 wān.

器 [qì] utensil; (机器 jīqi) machine; 武器 wǔqì weapon
From four 口 (kǒu) mouths and a 犬 (quǎn) dog.
	Utensils for feeding dogs? Dog-feeding machine?
	"The vessels for the 口 mouths, for eating. In the middle, a 犬 dog that cleans them" --Wieger.

优(F優) [yōu] excellent; 优良 fine; 优秀 outstanding; 优越 superior
From 亻(人 rén) 'person' and 尤 yóu phonetic. In the full form 優, the phonetic is 憂 yōu (which is the full form of 忧 yōu 'worry').

习(F習) [xí] 练习 practice; 学习 study; 习惯 habit
The full form 習 is 羽 over 白. The bottom was 自 zì, but from early times it was written with one less stroke so it looks like 白 bái.
	羽 yǔ represents wings; 自 zì is a picture of a nose, and means 'self', hence 習:
	"Young birds learning to fly; to practise; be familiar with; custom -- the seal has 自 below: use ones 自 own 羽 wings" --Karlgren.
	Wieger says 自 here means "Starting point, the origin, beginning, evolution; the nose being, according to the Chinese embryology, the starting point of the bodily evolution". Hence 習:
	"The 自(contracted) first attempts to 羽 fly, made by a young bird; 从羽, 从自, 会意。By extension, to repeat the same act, to practice."
	The simple form 习 is just half of 羽: one wing.

题(F題) [tí] topic; 问题 question, problem; 题目 title
From 是 shì phonetic and 页(頁 yè) 'head'.
	"Forehead; frontispiece, heading; theme, thesis, proposition; inscription; write, pronounce, mention" --Karlgren.
	Compare 提 tí 'raise'.

理 [lǐ] principle; 理论 lǐlùn theory; 管理 guǎnlǐ manage
From 王(玉 yù) 'jade' and 里 lǐ phonetic.
	The original meaning is 'texture', as in 纹理 wénlǐ grain in wood or veins in stone.
	"Polish gems according to the veins; dispose, regulate, manage, govern; rules, law; principle, doctrine, reason; reasonable, right." --Karlgren.

解 [jiě] separate; explain  [Xiè] (surname) [jiè] 解送
From 角 (jiǎo) 'horn', 刀 (dāo) 'knife', and 牛 (niú) 'ox'.
	"Cleave with a 刀 knife the 角 horn of 牛 an ox" --Karlgren.

苦 [kǔ] bitter; 艰苦 jiānkǔ arduous; 痛苦 tòngkǔ suffering
From 艹(草 cǎo) 'herbs' and 古 gǔ phonetic.

望 [wàng] look; full moon; 希望 xīwàng hope
Composed of 亡 wáng phonetic, 月 (yuè) 'moon' and 王 (wáng 'king').
	"Moon facing the sun, full moon; to face, gaze to a distance, look out for, long for, expect, hope -- 月 moon is signific and 亡 phonetic; below, the seal has 壬 (interpretation uncertain), not 王" --Karlgren.
	The bottom 壬 tǐng (now 王) depicted a person standing on the 土 (tǔ) earth, which is a suitable vantage point for moon-gazing. (You could think of 王 wáng and 亡 wáng as both being phonetic).

龙(F龍) [lóng] dragon; 恐龙 kǒnglóng dinosaur
"The dragon. When it ascends to heaven and flies, it rains; when it hides in the wells, there is a drought. Vapors and clouds personified." --Wieger.
	Don't confuse the simple form 龙 with 尤 yóu (as in 尤其 yóuqí 'especially').

凤(F鳳) [fèng] male phoenix (fabulous bird of good omen)
From 凡 fán phonetic and 鸟(鳥) 'bird'. The inner part has been abbreviated to 又 in the simple form 凤.
	Don't confuse with 风(風) fēng 'wind'.

良 [liáng] (优良 yōuliáng, 良好) good; 良心 liángxīn conscience
The explanation of 良 is obscure. The modern form is like 艮 (gèn) with a dot on top.

补(F補) [bǔ] mend
From 衤(衣 yī) 'clothing' and (full form:) 甫 fǔ or (simple form:)卜 bǔ phonetic.

休 [xiū] stop; (休息 xiūxi) rest; 退休 retire; 休养所 rest home
A 亻(人 rén) person stopping to rest under a 木 (mù) tree.

息 [xī] breath; stop  [xi] 消息 xiāoxi news; 休息 xiūxi rest
From 自 (zì) 'nose' and 心 (xīn) 'heart'.
	"To breathe, take breath; to rest, repose; stop, cease, extinguish; enjoy the rest, well-being, prosperity, profit, interest on money [利息]; to thrive, (have) sons and daughters" --Karlgren.
	熄 xī 'extinguish' is etymologically the same word.
	吸 xī 'inhale' is etymologically unrelated.

标(F標) [biāo] mark; 标准 biāozhǔn standard
From 木 (mù) 'wood' and 票 piào phonetic.
	票 is abbreviated to 示 in the simple form 标.

及 [jí] and; 以及 yǐjí as well as; 及时 jíshí promptly
Made of 人 and 又(): hand grabbing a person. Etymologically the same word as 急 jí 'urgent'.
	"Overtake, reach to, attain; together with, and; (attaining:) when" --Karlgren.

挥(F揮) [huī] wave, wield; command an army; 挥手 wave (one's hand)
From 扌(手 shǒu) 'hand' and 军(軍) jūn 'army'.
	Compare 辉 huī (光辉 'brilliance'). Why these both contain 军 jūn is "phonetically very curious" --Karlgren.

棒 [bàng] stick, bat; excellent; 棒球 bàngqiú baseball
From 木 (mù) 'wood' and 奉 fèng 'hold respectfully with both hands'.
	The component 奉 is signific as well as phonetic in 棒 (it suggests both the meaning and the sound).

强(F強) [qiáng] strong  [qiǎng] strive  [jiàng] 倔强 juéjiàng stubborn
The left side is 弓 gōng 'bow'. The right side 虽 is the modern simple form of 虽(雖) suī 'although'. A 弓 bow is strong, 虽 although it bends.
	The true explanation is obscure. An older form was 彊, with 畺 jiāng phonetic.
	"The character originally meant 'the larva of the corn-weevil' and was applied, as abbreviation for 彊, to the homophonous word 'strong'..." --Karlgren.
	The form 強 (with 厶 rather than 口) is one stroke less, but perversely we call 强 the "simple" form and 強 the "full" form, only because 强 is in the simple-form GB standard and 強 is in the full-form Big5 standard. This is one of those absurd situations where the "simple" form has more strokes than the "full" form.

调(F調) [diào] shift; tone  [tiáo] adjust
From 讠(言 yán) 'words' and 周 zhōu phonetic.

记(F記) [jì] (记得 jìde) remember; (记录 jìlù) record
From 讠(言 yán) 'words' and 己 jǐ (自己 zìjǐ 'self') phonetic.
	Compare 纪(紀) jì, one of whose meanings is also 'record'. Could they be etymologically related? Compare 记得 jìde 'remember', 纪念 jìniàn 'momento'.

硬 [yìng] hard; 硬件 yìngjiàn hardware
From 石 (shí) 'stone' and 更 gèng ('more') phonetic.

背 [bèi] back  [bēi] carry on the back; learn by heart; recite from memory
From 北 běi 'north' (the back side) and 月(肉 ròu) 'flesh'.
	北 depicts two people standing back to back.

喘 [chuǎn] (喘气 chuǎnqì) pant, gasp; 气喘 qìchuǎn asthma
From 口 (kǒu) 'mouth' and 耑 duān phonetic.
	耑 is the old form of 端 (极端 jíduān 'extremity').

尊 [zūn] (尊重, 尊敬) respect
A 寸 hand holding 酋 (yǒu) a wine cup, as an offering to ancestors, in worship. 寸 cùn may also be phonetic (originally there were two hands, which were changed to 寸 cùn "probably for phonetic reasons" --Karlgren).
	尊 zūn is phonetic in 遵 zūn 'obey', and in 蹲 dūn 'squat'. 尊 zūn 'respect' also suggests the meaning of 遵 zūn 'obey' but it might be far-fetched to suppose that 尊 zūn 'respect' suggests the meaning of 蹲 dūn 'squat'.

即 [jí] namely, that is; even if; (立即 lìjí) immediately
The left side  is from the bottom of 食 (shí) 'eat'; it depicts a pot of food. The right side 卩 is a person facing the food, just about to eat. Hence, 'immediately'. Compare 既 jì 'already', where the person is facing away, having already eaten, and 鄉(乡) xiāng 'countryside' where two folks are eating together.
	The right side 卩 jié was re-interpreted as a phonetic component.

启(F啟) [qǐ] open; start; enlighten; 启发 arouse, inspire
From 户 (戶 hù) 'door' and 口 (kǒu) 'mouth'.
	"To 口 open a 户 shutter" --Kargren.
	The full form 啟 and the variant form 啓 have 攵(攴 pū) 'beat' added, but the simple form 启 is older.

鼓 [gǔ] drum   [gū]; arouse; inspire; stimulate
From 壴 (zhù) 'drum' and 支 (zhī) a hand with a drumstick.
	Compare 喜 xǐ 'happiness'.

励(F勵) [lì] 鼓励 gǔlì, 激励 jīlì encourage; 奖励 reward
From 厉(厲) lì phonetic (li hai, formidable) and 力 (lì) 'strength'.

留 [liú] stay; 保留 keep; 遗留 hand down; 拘留 arrest
From (卯) mǎo phonetic and 田 (tián) 'field'.
	卯 is also phonetic in 贸 mào, 柳 liǔ, 聊 liáo, and 劉(刘) Liú.
	According to 王宏源, "In ancient times, the sounds 'm' and 'l' were not distinguished". That is hard to believe; maybe there was a consonant cluster ml-?.

童 [tóng] 儿童 értóng children
Originally from 辛 (xīn) 'suffering' and 重 chóng phonetic.
	"A menial, servant; boy or girl under 15 years of age; young, virgin, undefiled -- the seal has not 立 but 辛 a (criminal or of a criminal's family:) slave; 重 ...phonetic slightly abbreviated" --Karlgren.
	Compare 妾 qiè 'concubine'.
