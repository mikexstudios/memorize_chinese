Lesson 8 Words compiled by Michael Huynh

响(F響) [xiǎng] sound; 影响 yǐngxiǎng influence
The full form 響 is composed of 鄉 xiāng phonetic over 音 (yīn) 'sound'.
	The simple form 响 is completely different, composed of 口 (kǒu) 'mouth' and 向 (towards) xiàng phonetic. (It dates to the 明 dynasty, according to 李乐毅).

演 [yǎn] (表演 biǎoyǎn) perform, act, performance
From 氵(水 shuǐ) 'water' and 寅 yín (the third) phonetic.
	Why 氵(水) water? 演 yǎn also means 'evolve', and used to mean 'wide, extensive'. It originally described a river getting wider and extending towards the sea.
	The phonetic part 寅 yín means 'reverence', and is the third of the twelve 地支 Earthly Branches.

商 [shāng] discuss; business (store)
"It is formed by combination and fusion of 言 (yán) and 内 (nèi). The 口 mouth at the bottom of the compound, belongs to 言... To 言 express one's 内 interior feelings" --Wieger.
	"The seal has 言 and 内 interlaced" --Karlgren.
	The oldest oracle-bone forms of 商 did not have 口 (kǒu) at the bottom; the explanation of the original shape remains unclear.

堂 [táng] hall; 食堂 dining hall; 课堂 classroom  [tāng] 亮堂堂
From 尚 shàng (esteem, noble) phonetic over 土 (tǔ) 'land'.

艺(F藝) [yì] skill; (艺术 yìshù) art; 文艺 literature and art
"Agriculture, cultivate, art, profession; skill, cunning, rule, law; limit" --Karlgren.
	Originally 埶, from 坴 a 圥 plant on the 土 ground, and 丸 =  a hand planting it. To 埶 was added 艹 grass and 云 a cloud to water the crop, producing 藝 which is the full form. The simple form 艺 is just 艹 grass over 乙 yǐ phonetic.
	埶 also occurs in 热(熱) rè and 势(勢) shì.

术(F術) [shù] skill; (艺术 yìshù) art; 技术 technique  [zhú]
The simple form 术 depicts a kind of grain. (The original meaning is now written 秫 shú, with 禾 hé 'grain' added.)
	The full form 術 contains 术 phonetic and 行 (xíng) 'conduct'.
	The use of 术 as the modern simple form resulted by omitting 行.

偶 [ǒu] (偶然 ǒurán) by chance; even number (cf. 奇 jī odd)
From 亻(人 rén) 'person' and 禺 (spider monkey) yú phonetic.

尔(F爾) [ěr] (archaic:) you; 尔后 thereafter; 高尔夫 golf
Which came first, 尔 or 爾?
	Wieger cites this explanation for 尔:
		“从入丨八, 会意。八者气之分也。”
Then 爾 came from 尔 (phonetic), 巾 ( = 两 a balance) and 爻爻 weights on both sides, to give the meaning "symmetry, harmony of proportions".
	Karlgren(1923) says of the form 爾, "...original sense and hence explanation of character uncertain", and considers 尔 an abbreviation.
	The pronunciation was once something like nzie. This produced both ěr and nǐ, the latter written 你 nǐ, which is the modern word for 'you'. Now 尔 is only used in a few adverbs and archaic expressions, and in foreign loan words.

纪(F紀) [jì] 世纪 century; 纪念 memento; 纪律 discipline
From 纟(糸 sī) 'silk thread' and 己 jǐ (self).
	"Unravel threads; arrange, regulate, law; to record, year, age, dynasty" --Karlgren.
	This was the original meaning of 己 jǐ, and when 己 was borrowed for the sixth 天干 (and also the meaning 'self'), 糸 was added to produce 紀. Now 纪 jì is pronounced in the fourth (falling) tone, but when used as a proper name, it is Jǐ.
	It seems likely that 记 jì 'record, remember' is etymologically the same word, considering the overlap in meaning. Some words can be written with either 纪 or 记: 记录(纪录) 'keep minutes', 纪要(记要) 'summary of minutes'. (However, Karlgren makes no mention of the possibility of 纪 and 记 being etymologically related, nor of 己 being a picture of threads.)

录(F錄) [lù] record; 记录 jìlù take notes; 录音机 tape recorder
There are various contradictory explanations for the shape of 录, none of them very helpful. The original meaning is obscure. Now 录 is used as the simple form of 錄 lù 'record', the full form of which contains 金 (jīn) 'gold'.
	The top is written slightly differently: 彔, not 录, in full form characters such as 綠錄剝祿 (but there are variant forms 緑録). In simple form characters the shape is 录 (绿剥禄 etc.).

闲(F閑) [xián] idle; free time; 闲话 digression; complaint
From 门(門 mén) 'door' and 木 (mù) 'tree'. Why do we see a 木 tree through the 門 door? We might also see the 日 (rì) sun or the 月 (yuè) moon. 闲(閑) xián 'free time' and 间(間) jiān 'space' were both formerly represented by 閒:
	"A 門 door through the crevice of which the 月 moonshine peeps in" --Karlgren.
	閑 xián once meant 'barrier' ("The 木 wood piece across a 門 door" --Karlgren). Now 闲(閑) is used in place of 閒 for xián 'free time'. This substitution might have been influenced by the function of 木 (mù) 'tree' in 休 xiū 'rest'.

频(F頻) [pín] 频率 pínlǜ frequency
From 步 (bù) 'step' and 页(頁 yè) 'head'.

闻(F聞) [wén] smell; hear; 新闻 news
From 门(門) mén 'door' and 耳 (ěr) 'ear'.
	An 耳 ear listening at a 门 door. 门 mén is phonetic as well as signific, compare 问 wèn.

通 [tōng] (通过) go through; 交通 traffic  [tòng] (measure word)
From 甬 yǒng phonetic and 辶(辵 chuò) 'go'.
	"Penetrate, pervade; wholly, complete, homogeneous, uniform, general; completely know; communicate, intercourse" --Karlgren.

童 [tóng] 儿童 értóng children
Originally from 辛 (xīn) 'suffering' and 重 chóng phonetic.
	"A menial, servant; boy or girl under 15 years of age; young, virgin, undefiled -- the seal has not 立 but 辛 a (criminal or of a criminal's family:) slave; 重 ...phonetic slightly abbreviated" --Karlgren.
	Compare 妾 qiè 'concubine'.

引 [yǐn] draw, stretch; (引起 yǐnqǐ) cause; (吸引 xīyǐn) attract
From 弓 (gōng) 'bow' (as in 弓箭 gōngjiàn 'bow and arrow') plus a vertical line depicting the string.
	"Draw towards oneself; lead, guide; induce; introduce, quote; prolong -- the 丨string of a 弓 bow" --Karlgren.

据(F據) [jù] seize; depend on; (根据 gēnjù) according to  [jū] 拮据
From 扌(手 shǒu) 'hand' and (full form:) 豦 jù or (simple form:) 居 (live, reside) jū phonetic.

模 [mó] 模范 model; 模仿 imitate  [mú] 模样 appearance; 模子
From 木 (mù) 'wood' and 莫 mò (nothing, greatest, baffling) phonetic.

柴 [chái] firewood; 火柴 huǒchái match; 柴油 cháiyóu diesel oil

The bottom is 火 (huǒ) 'fire'.
	The top is 宀 (mián) 'roof', meaning a house on fire; or 巛 (川 chuān) 'river', meaning floods and fires.

烧(F燒) [shāo] roast, cook; burn (cf 炒 chǎo stir-fry)
From 火 (huǒ) 'fire' and 尧(堯) yáo phonetic.

死 [sǐ] die, death
From 歹 (dǎi) 'bad, broken bones' and 匕, which is 人 (rén) 'person' , turned upside-down, just as in 化 huà 'change'.

乱(F亂) [luàn] chaotic, disorderly, messy; 混乱 hùnluàn chaos
The original meaning was 'unravel':
	"爪又 two hands working with 幺 silk threads hung up on 冂 a stand" --Karlgren.
	乚 was added to represent one of the threads. The simplification of the left side to 舌 is at least a thousand years old (广韵). The meaning has drifted from 'unravel' to 'disorder'. Although 乱 was not really derived from 舌 shé 'tongue', one might construe sticking one's 舌 tongue out as a form of 乱 disorderly conduct.

糟 [zāo] rotten; 糟糕 zāogāo bad luck! 糟踏 zāota waste, spoil
From 米 (mǐ) 'rice' and 曹 cáo phonetic.
	Compare 遭 zāo 'meet with disaster'.

怪 [guài] blame; (奇怪 qíguài) strange; 怪物 guàiwu monster
From 忄(心 xīn) 'heart' and 圣. 圣 here is not really 圣(聖) shèng 'holy', but an obsolete character, used in 怪 guài as a phonetic:
	圣 "to work in the fields -- from 又 hand and 土 earth, soil; character sometimes used as an abbreviation for 聖" --Karlgren.

免 [miǎn] exempt; 避免 bìmiǎn avoid; 免费 miǎnfèi free

	Compare 兔 tù 'rabbit' which is the same except for an additional dot.

向 [xiàng] towards (direction); (F曏) formerly

From 木 (mù) 'wood' and 仓(倉) cāng phonetic.

借 [jiè] borrow, lend
From 亻(人 rén) 'person' and 昔 xī phonetic.

负(F負) [fù] carry on shoulder; suffer; negative
The top ⺈ is 人 (rén) 'person'. 贝(貝 bèi) means shells, or money --- a burden? a fine? a reward for carring a burden?

责(F責) [zé] duty; 责任 zérèn responsibility
The top  was originally 朿 cì phonetic.
	The bottom is 贝(貝 bèi) 'money'.
	"From 貝 (a fine) signific and 朿 phonetic, the latter now badly deformed" --Karlgren.
	责 is phonetic in 绩 jī and 债 zhài.

任 [rèn] appoint; no matter; 任务 task; 任何 any  [Rén] (surname)
Originally written 壬, a 丨carrying pole supported in the middle with one object attached at each end: to carry weight on the shoulder. 亻(人 rén) 'person' was added, making 任, while the original form 壬 was borrowed for 壬 rén the ninth heavenly stem.

盾 [dùn] shield; 矛盾 máodùn contradiction ("spear-shield")

From 戌 (xū) 'destroy' (picture of a weapon) and 女 (nǚ) 'woman'.

胁(F脅) [xié] upper part of side of person's body; coerce
The full form 脅 is 劦 xié phonetic over 月(肉 ròu) 'flesh'.
	The simple form 胁 is 月 plus 办 (bàn).
	劦 is the old form of 协(協) xié 'cooperate'.

炸 [zhà] (爆炸 bàozhà) explode, blow up  [zhá] deep fry
From 火 (huǒ) 'fire' and 乍 zhà.
