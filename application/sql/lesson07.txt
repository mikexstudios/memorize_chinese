Lesson 7 Words compiled by Michael Huynh

事 [shì] thing, event; 事情 shìqing situation
It appears that 事 shì 'event', 史 shǐ 'history', and 吏 lì 'officer', and the right side of 使 shǐ 'make' were all originally the same: a hand holding some unknown object. These words are believed to be cognates.

闹(F鬧) [nào] (热闹) noisy; 闹钟 alarm clock
The full form 鬧 is 鬥 (dòu) 'fight' plus 市 (shì) 'market'.
	"鬥 fight in 市 the market" --Karlgren.
	The abbreviation to 閙, with 門 (mén) 'door' instead of 鬥, has existed since the Song dynasty. The simple form is 闹. As noisy as having a 市 market place just outside your 门 door.

翻 [fān] turn over; 翻译 fānyì translate
From 番 fān and 羽 'feathers'.

详(F詳) [xiáng] 详细 detailed; 端详 details; 安详 serene
From 讠(言 yán) 'words' and 羊 yáng phonetic.

细(F細) [xì] thin; 仔细 zǐxì careful; 细胞 xìbāo cell; 详细 detailed
From 纟(糸 sī) 'thread' and 田 (tián 'field').
	"The 糸 (thread:) hair of the 田 head, see 思" --Karlgren.
	田 by itself means 'field', but here it represents a head.

况(F況) [kuàng] 情况 circumstances; 况且 moreover
From 冫(二 èr) 'two' and 兄 xiōng phonetic.
	In this case 冫 does not mean 'water' or 'ice', it is from 二 'two': secondly; moreover.
	The character 況, in which the left side is 氵(水 shuǐ) 'water', was originally a different (obsolete) word 況 huàng 'ice water', but now 況 is used in place of 况 among full form characters.

性 [xìng] sex; nature; -ness
From 忄(心 xīn) 'heart' and 生 shēng 'birth'. Cognate with 生 and 姓 xìng 'family name'.

格 [gé] check, pattern, standard; 格外 géwài especially  [gē]
From 木 (mù) 'wood' and 各 gè phonetic. 木 might convey the idea of carpentry, hence 'pattern'.

朗 [lǎng] 爽朗 shuǎnglǎng, 明朗 bright & clear; 朗讼 recite
From (良 liáng) phonetic and 月 (yuè) 'moon'. 良 is abbreviated by one stroke here, to .

脾 [pí] spleen; 脾气 píqi (bad-) temper
From 月(肉 ròu) 'flesh' and 卑 bēi.

急 [jí] urgent; 着急 zháojí anxious; 急忙 jímáng in a hurry
The top 刍 was originally 及 jí, which is a 又 hand grabbing a 人 person. 急 and 及 are cognate; 急 is enlarged by 心 (xīn) 'heart'. In 急, the 人 person is written ⺈, and the 又 hand is written 彐, but the similarity to 刍(芻) chú 'hay' is accidental. The 急 in 隐(隱) yǐn and 稳(穩) wěn has yet another origin.

躁 [zào] rash, impetuous
From ⻊(足 zú) 'foot' and 喿 zào phonetic.

趣 [qù] interest, fun; 兴趣 interest; 趣味 interest; taste
From 走 (zǒu) 'go' and and 取 qǔ ('take') phonetic.

戏(F戲) [xì] (戏剧 xìjù) drama, play; 游戏 yóuxì game
The right side is 戈 (gē) 'spear' -- for use in games and theatrical productions.
	The left side of the full form 戲 is 虍 tiger over 豆 vase, an obsolete character ("sacrificial vessel -- a 豆 vase with 虍 tiger shape or ornaments" --Karlgren), used as a phonetic in 戲 xì.
	In the simple form 戏, the left side is 又 (yòu) 'hand'.

古 [gǔ] (古代 gǔdài) ancient
Composed of 十 (shí) 'ten' over 口 (kǒu) 'mouth'.
	"That which has passed through 十 ten 口 mouths, i.e. a tradition dating back ten generations" --Wieger.

典 [diǎn] 典型 diǎnxíng typical; 古典 classical; 词典 dictionary
Two hands holding a 册 (cè) document made of bamboo strips tied together.

摇(F搖) [yáo] shake
From 扌(手 shǒu) 'hand' and 䍃() yáo ('jar') phonetic.

滚(F滾) [gǔn] roll; boil
From 氵(水 shuǐ) 'water' and 衮(袞) gǔn phonetic.
	"Seethe, boil; to roll" --Karlgren.
	The phonetic part 衮 gǔn means 'ancient monarch's ceremonial attire'. It is composed of 衣 (yī) 'clothing' and 公 (gōng) 'public'.

往 [wǎng] to, toward; 往往 wǎngwǎng often
From 彳 'walk' and 王 wáng phonetic; the 丶 dot over 王 is only there to confuse you, nothing to do with 主 zhǔ.
	Formerly the pronunciation wàng (falling tone) was standard in some contexts, but now wǎng (dipping tone) is standard wherever 往 occurs.

相 [xiāng] each other, mutual  [xiàng] look at; appearance; photo
From 木 mù 'tree' and 目 mù 'eye'.
	"An 目 eye, spying, looking out from behind a 木 tree" --Karlgren.
	"...The abstract meaning of reciprocity...is said to come from a kind of pun, the two elements 木 and 目 both being pronounced mù" --Wieger.

背 [bèi] back  [bēi] carry on the back
From 北 běi 'north' (the back side) and 月(肉 ròu) 'flesh'.
	北 depicts two people standing back to back.

景 [jǐng] scene, scenery
From 日 (rì) 'sun' and 京 jīng phonetic.

噢 [ō] Oh (interjection)
From 口 (kǒu) 'mouth' and 奥 ào (secret) phonetic.

醉 [zuì] drunk
From 酉 (yǒu) 'wine' and 卒 zú ('soldier') phonetic.

厉(F厲) [lì] 厉害 terrible; formidable  [lài] (name of ancient country)
From 厂 (chǎng) 'cliff' and 万(萬 wàn) 'ten thousand'.
	Karlgren says the original meaning was 'whetstone' (砺), which hardly explains why it is composed of 厂 and 萬. 说文 says 蠆 chài was phonetic (abbreviated), which seems dubious.
	Be careful not to confuse 厉(厲) lì with 历(歷) lì 'experience'.

害 [hài] harmful; 害虫 hàichóng destructive insect; 厉害 lìhai fierce
The top is 宀 (mián) 'roof' and the bottom is 口 (kǒu) 'mouth'. The middle looks like 丰 (fēng) in the modern character. The explanation is obscure (see the picture in 汉语大字典; the bottom looks like 古 gǔ).
	害 hài is phonetic in 割 gē 'cut'.

镜(F鏡) [jìng] (镜子) mirror; lens; 眼镜 yǎnjìng glasses
From 钅(金 jīn) 'metal' and 竟 jìng (finish, unexpectedly) phonetic.

怪 [guài] blame; (奇怪 qíguài) strange; 怪物 guàiwu monster
From 忄(心 xīn) 'heart' and 圣. 圣 here is not really 圣(聖) shèng 'holy', but an obsolete character, used in 怪 guài as a phonetic:
	圣 "to work in the fields -- from 又 hand and 土 earth, soil; character sometimes used as an abbreviation for 聖" --Karlgren.

挺 [tǐng] quite, very; endure, stand; 挺立 stand upright
From 扌(手 shǒu) 'hand' and 廷 tíng.

悔 [huǐ] (后悔 hòuhuǐ) regret, repent
From 忄(心 xīn) 'heart' and 每 měi phonetic.

假 [jiǎ] false  [jià] (假期 jiàqī) vacation
Originally 叚 was 二 (èr) 'two' plus 皮 (pí) 'skin': 二 second (false) 皮 skin. 亻(人 rén) 'person' was added later.
	Not to be confused with 段 duàn 'section'.

憋 [biē] check, restrain, suppress; suffocate, feel depressed
From 敝 bì ('shabby') phonetic and (心 xīn) 'heart'.

死 [sǐ] die, death
From 歹 (dǎi) 'bad, broken bones' and 匕, which is 人 (rén) 'person' , turned upside-down, just as in 化 huà 'change'.

演 [yǎn] (表演 biǎoyǎn) perform, act, performance
From 氵(水 shuǐ) 'water' and 寅 yín phonetic.
	Why 氵(水) water? 演 yǎn also means 'evolve', and used to mean 'wide, extensive'. It originally described a river getting wider and extending towards the sea.
	The phonetic part 寅 yín means 'reverence', and is the third of the twelve 地支 Earthly Branches.

部 [bù] (部分 bùfen) part; 西部 western part; 全部 entire
From 咅 pǒu phonetic and 阝(邑 yì) 'city'.

谈(F談) [tán] talk
From 讠(言 yán) 'words' and 炎 yán ('burning hot') phonetic.

华(F華) [huá] magnificent; China    [Huà] (surname); 华山
"Etymologically the same word as 花; analysis of character uncertain, perhaps simply a picture of a luxuriant tree" --Karlgren(1923).
	The simple form 华 is 化 huà phonetic over 十, which is just the bottom two strokes of the full form 華.
	Compare 毕(畢) bì.

姆 [mǔ] nurse; 汤姆 Tāngmǔ Tom
From 女 (nǚ) 'woman' and 母 mǔ 'mother'.
	Cognate with 母.

丽(F麗) [lì] 美丽 beautiful; 壮丽 majestic  [Lí] Korea
