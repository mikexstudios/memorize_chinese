Lesson 18 Words compiled by Michael Huynh

æ”¯ [zhÄ«] branch; support; æ”¯æŒ zhÄ«chÃ­ sustain m. (for slender objects, military contingents, songs, wattage, etc.) 
A åˆ (yÃ²u) hand holding a å branch. The branch happens to look like å shÃ­ 'ten' in the modern writing. The character æ zhÄ«, with æœ¨ (mÃ¹) 'wood' added, is now used for 'branch of a tree'.

çŠ¯ [fÃ n] violate; çŠ¯ç½ª fÃ n=zuÃ¬ commit a crime; ç½ªçŠ¯ criminal
From çŠ­(çŠ¬ quÇn) 'dog' and ã”¾ hÇn 'sprout'.
	"To ã”¾ rush like a çŠ¬ dog. To invade, to offend. Compare çª. In the symbolism of characters, the dog plays a considerable, though not creditable part. ä¾µä¹Ÿã€‚ä»çŠ¬, ä»ã”¾ã€‚è¨€çŠ¬çŠ¯äººã€‚è½¬æ³¨ä¸ºå‡¡å¹²é™µè¿ é“ä¹‹ç§°ã€‚" --Wieger.
	Karlgren says ã”¾ hÇn ('sprout', an obsolete character) was phonetic.

ç½ª [zuÃ¬] crime, guilt
From ç½’(ç½‘ wÇng) 'net' over é (fÄ“i) 'wrong' (not).
	A ç½‘ net used to capture the criminal who has done é wrong.

çŒ(Fçµ) [liÃ¨] æ‰“çŒ hunt; çŒäºº hunter; çŒç‹— hound
From çŠ­(çŠ¬ quÇn) 'dog' and å·¤ liÃ¨ phonetic.
	In the simple form çŒ, å·¤ is replaced by æ˜” (xi - former times, past), as with èœ¡(è Ÿ) lÃ  'wax' and è…Š(è‡˜) lÃ  (è…Šè‚  'sausage'). (But æ˜” xÄ« is the original phonetic in é”™ cuÃ², æƒœ xÄ«, å€Ÿ jiÃ¨ etc.)

å± [wÄ“i] å±é™© dangerous; å±æœº crisis; å±å®³ endanger
A âºˆ(äºº) person standing over å‚ a cliff. The true interpretation of ã”¾ is uncertain.
	The resemblence to å„ Ã¨ 'disaster' is coincidental, but the re-interpretation of å± as "a âºˆ( äºº) person on the brink of a å„ disaster" is irresistable.

æ”¶ [shÅu] gather; æ”¶æ‹¾ put in order; æ”¶è· harvest; æ”¶éŸ³æœº radio
From ä¸© (jiÅ«) 'hook' andæ”µ(æ”´ pÅ«) 'beat'.
	"To æ”´ mow with ä¸© a 'hook', a sickle" --Karglren.

ç¢° [pÃ¨ng] bump into; ç¢°è§ happen to meet
From çŸ³ (shÃ­) 'stone' and ä¸¦ bÃ¬ng (and, equally, truly) phonetic.
	ä¸¦ is a variant form of å¹¶ (combine, merge) bÃ¬ng.

æ™º [zhÃ¬] æ™ºæ…§ zhÃ¬huÃ¬ wisdom; æ™ºåŠ› zhÃ¬lÃ¬ intellegence
From çŸ¥ zhÄ« 'know' over æ—¥ (rÃ¬) 'sun'. æ™º zhÃ¬ 'wisdom' and çŸ¥ zhÄ« 'know' are cognate words; notice the difference in tone. æ—¥ conveys the notion of brightness.

å¼„ [nÃ²ng] do   [lÃ²ng] é‡Œå¼„ alley
From ç‹(ç‰ yÃ¹) 'jade' over å»¾(î¿Ÿ gÇ’ng) two hands.

æŠ¤(Fè­·) [hÃ¹] (ä¿æŠ¤ bÇohÃ¹) guard, protect; æŠ¤å£« hÃ¹shi nurse
From æ‰Œ(æ‰‹ shÇ’u) 'hand' and æˆ· hÃ¹ ('door') phonetic.
	The full form è­· is completely different: from è¨€ (yÃ¡n) 'words' and è’¦ huÃ² phonetic.

è­¦ [jÇng] è­¦å¯Ÿ jÇngchÃ¡ police; è­¦å‘Š jÇnggÃ o warn
From æ•¬ jÃ¬ng ('respect') phonetic over è¨€ (yÃ¡n) 'words'.

å¯Ÿ [chÃ¡] è§‚å¯Ÿ guÄnchÃ¡ observe; è­¦å¯Ÿ jÇngchÃ¡ police
From å®€ (miÃ¡n) 'roof' and ç¥­ jÃ¬ (sacrifice) phonetic (the ancient sounds were ç¥­ *ts'at and å¯Ÿ *tsai).
	å¯Ÿ chÃ¡ is not to be confused with æŸ¥ chÃ¡ 'examine' (which is etymologically unrelated).

æ•‘ [jiÃ¹] help, rescue; æ•‘å‘½ jiÃ¹mÃ¬ng! Help!
From æ±‚ qiÃº (seek, ask) phonetic and æ”µ(æ”´ pÅ«) 'beat'.

å‘½ [mÃ¬ng] (ç”Ÿå‘½) life; destiny; å‘½ä»¤ command; é©å‘½ revolution
Like ä»¤ lÃ¬ng (as in å‘½ä»¤ mÃ¬nglÃ¬ng 'command'); å‘½ mÃ¬ng has an added å£ kÇ’u 'mouth'.

é›‡ [gÃ¹] (é›‡ä½£ gÃ¹yÅng) hire, employ; é›‡ä¸» employer; é›‡å‘˜ employee
From æˆ· hÃ¹ (door, household, window) phonetic and éš¹ (zhuÄ«) 'little bird'. Originally é›‡ meant 'hawfinch' (a kind of bird). The character was borrowed for a similar sounding word meaning 'hire'.
	é›‡ is phonetic in é¡§(é¡¾) gÃ¹.

ç›‘(Fç›£) [jiÄn] ç›‘ç‹± prison; ç›‘ç£ supervise  [jiÃ n]
Originally from å§ (wÃ²) 'bend down' over è¡€ (xuÃ¨) 'blood'.
	"The seal has: to å§ bend over a è¡€ sacrificial bowl with blood: examine the omen" --Karlgren.
	The dot on top of è¡€ got moved up under åœ.
	In the simple form ç›‘, è‡£ got abbreviated to two strokes.
	ç›‘ is a phonetic component in æ§› jiÃ n 'cage', and ç›‘ is simplified to î¿¤ in é‰´(é‘’) jiÃ n 'examine; mirror'.
	Also see è“ç¯®å…° lÃ¡n, è§ˆ lÇn, ç› yÃ¡n, and ä¸´ lÃ­n.

ç‹±(Fç„) [yÃ¹] lawsuit; (ç›‘ç‹± jiÄnyÃ¹) prison, jail
From çŠ­(çŠ¬ quÇn) 'dog', è® (è¨€ yÃ¡n) 'words' and çŠ¬ (quÇn) another dog. Words between dogs: lawsuit: prison.
	Compare è¾©(è¾¯) biÃ n 'argue': è¨€ words between è¾› criminals. Also é› (è®) chÃ³u 'enemy': è¨€ words between éš¹ birds.

è„š(Fè…³) [jiÇo] foot; èµ¤è„š barefoot; è„šè¶¾ toe  [juÃ©] (=è§’)
From æœˆ(è‚‰ rÃ²u) 'flesh' and å´(å») quÃ¨ (however) phonetic.

æŸ¥ [chÃ¡] examine, investigate; æ£€æŸ¥ inspect  [ZhÄ] (surname)
Originally æŸ», from æœ¨ (mÃ¹) 'wood' over ä¸” qiÄ› (for time being, moreover) phonetic, but the modern character is written with æ—¦ (dÃ n 'dawn') at the bottom. The original meaning was 'raft' (hence æœ¨ 'wood'); then the character was borrowed for the word chÃ¡ 'examine' which happened to sound the same.
	Not to be confused with å¯Ÿ chÃ¡ as in è§‚å¯Ÿ guÄnchÃ¡ 'observe'.

è§„(Fè¦) [guÄ«] è§„å¾‹ guÄ«lÇœ regular pattern; è§„å®š guÄ«dÃ¬ng regulations
From å¤« (fÅ«) 'man' (originally çŸ¢ shÇ 'arrow'), and è§(è¦‹ jiÃ n) 'see'.
	When the å¤« Man is è§ watching, you have to follow the rules. That is not the true explanation of è§„, however.
	"The seal has, besides è¦‹ (look, control), not å¤« but çŸ¢ arrow, used as a pointed tracing instrument" --Karlgren.
	 "To have the è¦‹ eye to something, in order to make it straight as an çŸ¢ arrow" --Wieger.

æ‰§(FåŸ·) [zhÃ­] hold in hand; æ‰§è¡Œ zhÃ­xÃ­ng carry out
The left side å¹¸ (simplified to æ‰Œ) depicted handcuffs, and the right side ä¸¸ depicted a person whose hands are locked in the handcuffs.
	No relation to ä¸¸ wÃ¡n 'pellet'. Whether there is a historical relation to å¹¸ xÃ¬ng 'lucky' is unclear.
	çƒ­(ç†±) rÃ¨ and åŠ¿(å‹¢) shÃ¬ are from åŸ¶ yÃ¬, not from æ‰§(åŸ·).

ç¦ [jÃ¬n] (ç¦æ­¢ jÃ¬nzhÇ) prohibit  [jÄ«n] endure; ä¸ç¦ can't resist
From æ— lÃ­n phonetic over ç¤º (shÃ¬) 'indicate'.

æ­¢ [zhÇ] (åœæ­¢ tÃ­ngzhÇ) stop
Picture of a left footprint. The toes were at the top, the heel at the bottom. Sometimes written î¿, as in èµ° zÇ’u. See è¶³ zÃº 'foot', æ­¥ bÃ¹ 'step', and ç–‹ shÅ«.
	æ­¢ zhÇ now means 'stop' (hold the feet still). The original meaning 'foot' survives in è¶¾ zhÇ as in è„šè¶¾ jiÇozhÇ 'toe'. Also, å€ zhÇ as in åœ°å€ dÃ¬zhÇ 'address' is etymologically the same word.
	æ­¢ is the 77th of the 214 radicals.

ç§ [sÄ«] (ç§äºº) personal; (ç§æœ‰) private; (è‡ªç§) selfish
From ç¦¾ (hÃ©) 'grain' and å¶ sÄ« (no definition).

å®ª(Fæ†²) [xiÃ n] å®ªæ³• xiÃ nfÇ constitution; å®ªå…µ military police
The full form æ†² is å®€ over ä¸° over ç½’ over å¿ƒ. The explanation is not clear.

éšœ [zhÃ ng] éšœç¢ zhÃ ng'Ã i obstruct; ä¿éšœ bÇozhÃ ng ensure

From æœ¨ (mÃ¹) 'wood' and é›š guÃ n phonetic.
	é›š is abbreviated to åˆ yÃ²u (both, again) in the simple form æƒ.
	The primary meaning is 'to weigh or balance', as in the phrase æƒå…¶è½»é‡ 'weigh up the matter carefully'. Possibly ancient scales were made of æœ¨ wood, rather than metal.

åˆ© [lÃ¬] (åˆ©ç›Š lÃ¬yÃ¬) benefit, profit; åˆ©ç”¨ utilize; èƒœåˆ© triumph
From ç¦¾ (hÃ©) 'grain' and åˆ‚(åˆ€ dÄo) 'knife'. Harvest the ç¦¾ grain with a åˆ€ knife: benefit, profit.

é™ [xiÃ n] limit, bounds; æœ‰é™ limited; é™åˆ¶ restrict
From é˜(é˜œ fÃ¹) 'hill' and è‰® gÃ¨n (â˜¶ Keeping Still) phonetic.

åˆ¶ [zhÃ¬] (åˆ¶åº¦) system; (æ§åˆ¶) control; (Fè£½)(åˆ¶é€ ) manufacture
The left side is derived from æœª (wÃ¨i), a tree with many branches, written in a slightly different way. The right side is åˆ‚(åˆ€ dÄo) 'knife'.
	"To åˆ€ trim a large tree with many branches" --Karlgren.
	Among full form characters, a distinction is made between åˆ¶ zhÃ¬ and è£½ zhÃ¬, although they are etymologically the same word; the form è£½ is used when the meaning is 'manufacture'. Among simple form characters only åˆ¶ occurs.

ç¾” [gÄo] ç¾Šç¾” yÃ¡nggÄo lamb
From í¡˜í½Œ(ç¾Š yÃ¡ng) 'sheep' and ç¬(ç« huÇ’) 'fire'.

From å¥³ (nÇš) 'woman' and æ”¯ zhÄ«.

å‡»(Fæ“Š) [jÄ«] beat, strike
Originally æ¯„, from è» and æ®³ (shÅ«) 'beat'. The meaning was, to jostle or bump, å£ representing the end of a è»Š (chÄ“) war chariot's axle. æ¯„ became í¡íº  by the omission of one stroke. Then a æ‰‹ (shÇ’u) hand was added, forming æ“Š. The modern simple form is å‡».
	Compare ç¹‹ xÃ¬, also a rare character å¢¼ jÄ«.

å· [tÅu] steal; å°å· xiÇotÅu thief
From äº»(äºº rÃ©n) 'person' and ä¿ yÃº (surname, small boat) phonetic.

The simple form çªƒ is composed of ç©´ (xuÃ©) 'hole' over åˆ‡ qiÃ¨ phonetic.

â€œFault, evil; transgress; still more, furthermore; extraordinary; (find fault:) grudge --- a deformed å¤§ man? Cf. å°¢ wÄngâ€ --Karlgren.
	By far the most common usage of the character å°¤ yÃ³u is in the word å°¤å…¶ yÃ³uqÃ­ 'especially'.
 	å°¤ is a component in ä¼˜(å„ª) yÅu 'excellent'.
	Don't confuse å°¤ with é¾™(é¾) lÃ³ng 'dragon'.

ä¹‹ [zhÄ«] 's (similar to çš„ de); it (classical pronoun)
Originally from æ­¢ zhÇ 'foot', with a ä¸€ line below it. æ­¢ may have indicated both the sound and the meaning of ä¹‹ (the meaning was once similar to å‡º chÅ« 'go out').
	The radical of ä¹‹, strangely, is ä¸¿, even though ä¸¿ is not one of the three strokes of ä¹‹.

äº§(Fç”¢) [chÇn] (äº§ç”Ÿ chÇnshÄ“ng) produce; äº§å“ chÇnpÇn product
The full form ç”¢ or ç”£ is like å½¦(å½¥) yÃ n 'virtue', but with ç”Ÿ shÄ“ng 'life' in place of å½¡. In the simple form äº§, ç”Ÿ has been left out. å½¦ yÃ n, which occurs in é¢œ (é¢œè‰² yÃ¡nsÃ¨ 'color'), represents lines and wrinkles (like æ–‡ wÃ©n).
	"The å½¦ wrinkles formed on the body consequent upon ç”Ÿ child-birth. Fecundity, to bear, to produce" --Wieger.

From å¤« (fÅ«) 'man' (originally çŸ¢ shÇ 'arrow'), and è§(è¦‹ jiÃ n) 'see'.
	When the å¤« Man is è§ watching, you have to follow the rules. That is not the true explanation of è§„, however.
	"The seal has, besides è¦‹ (look, control), not å¤« but çŸ¢ arrow, used as a pointed tracing instrument" --Karlgren.
	 "To have the è¦‹ eye to something, in order to make it straight as an çŸ¢ arrow" --Wieger.

From äº»(äºº rÃ©n) 'person' and ä¹ƒ (nÇi).
	ä¹ƒ here is a "technical abbreviation for another old character, also of uncertain analysis" --Karlgren.
	Compare æ‰” rÄ“ng 'throw'.

ç‡ [lÇœ] rate, proportion; é¢‘ç‡ frequency  [shuÃ i] ç‡é¢† lead
Said (by è¯´æ–‡) to depict a net for catching birds (like æ¯•ç•¢ bÃ¬), but the oldest forms of ç‡ are simply å¹º (yÄo) 'silk cocoons' surrounded by short strokes (threads?).
	"Picture of a net; etymologically same word as å¸…" --Karlgren.
	It isn't clear how there came to be two such different pronunciations, shuÃ i and lÇœ, for the single character ç‡. The pronunciation lÇœ is mentioned by neither Wieger nor Karlgren.

ä½ [dÄ«] low; é™ä½ jiÃ ngdÄ« reduce; ä½çº§ elementary; é«˜ä½ height
From äº»(äºº rÃ©n) 'person' and æ° dÇ 'foundation'. ä½ dÄ« 'low' is etymologically related to æ° dÇ 'foundation' and åº• dÇ 'bottom'.
	Compare æŠµ dÇ 'resist'.
