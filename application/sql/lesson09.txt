Lesson 9 Words

ä»£ [dÃ i] (ä»£è¡¨ dÃ ibiÇo) represent; (æ—¶ä»£ shÃ­dÃ i) generation
From äº»(äºº rÃ©n) 'person' and å¼‹ yÃ¬ (an arrow with string attached). 	Karlgren proves that å¼‹ yÃ¬ is phonetic in ä»£ dÃ i and also in å¼ shÃ¬; this may not be very helpful since the sounds have changed so much.
	Be sure to distinguish ä»£ dÃ i from ä¼ fÃ¡ 'cut down'.

ç§» [yÃ­] (ç§»åŠ¨) move; è½¬ç§» shift; transform; ç§»æ¤ transplant
From ç¦¾ (hÃ©) 'grain' and å¤š duÅ phonetic (sic).
	The original meaning is 'transplant', hence ç¦¾ (hÃ©) 'grain'.

æ›¾ [cÃ©ng] (æ›¾ç» cÃ©ngjÄ«ng) in the past  [zÄ“ng] great- (grandmother)
æ›¾ is like æœƒ(ä¼š) huÃ¬ 'meet', with ä¸·(å…« bÄ) at the top instead of î¿©. Supposing that æœƒ depicts a rice-cooking pot with a î¿© lid, as some modern scholars believe, then æ›¾ might be the pot with the lid removed. This could imply that the rice has been eaten 'in the past'. It is time to add some more rice, hence 'increase'.
	The pronunciation is æ›¾ zÄ“ng only as a prefix 'great-', as in æ›¾å­™ zÄ“ngsÅ«n 'great-grandson'. It is etymologically the same word as å¢ as in å¢åŠ  zÄ“ngjiÄ 'increase'.

é™†(Fé™¸) [lÃ¹] land; å¤§é™† continent   [liÃ¹] six ( = å…­)
Originally written å´, from åœ¥ lÃ¹ phonetic over åœŸ (tÇ”) 'earth'. Later é˜(é˜œ fÃ¹) 'hill' was added. In the simple form, å´ was reduced to å‡». The element å´ also occurs in ç¦ mÃ¹ 'friendly'; don't confuse é™¸ with é™µ lÃ­ng.
	é™†(é™¸) is sometimes used for å…­ liÃ¹ 'six' in financial documents to discourage alteration.

ç¡®(Fç¢º) [quÃ¨] true; æ­£ç¡® correct; ç¡®å® indeed; æ˜ç¡® explicit
çŸ³ (shÃ­) 'stone' indicates the meaning: solid, firm, certain.
	In the full form ç¢º the phonetic part is éšº hÃ¨. In the simple form ç¡® the phonetic part is è§’ jiÇo.

å¦ [fÇ’u] no; æ˜¯å¦ whether   [pÇ] ï€¸ Standstill
From ä¸ bÃ¹ 'no' and å£ (kÇ’u) 'mouth'
	Compare æ­ª wÄi (crooked).

åˆ™(Få‰‡) [zÃ©] (conjunction); åŸåˆ™ yuÃ¡nzÃ© principle; å¦åˆ™ fÇ’uzÃ© or else
From è´(è² bÃ¨i) 'money' and åˆ‚(åˆ€ dÄo) 'knife'.
	"To åˆ€ carve a è² shell = pattern? or: åˆ€ amputation and è² a fine = law (cf è²¬ zÃ©)?" --Karlgren.
	Phonetic in æµ‹ä¾§å• cÃ¨.

æ•£ [sÃ n] break up; distribute; dispel  [sÇn] fall apart; scattered
From î¿ , æœˆ(è‚‰ rÃ²u) 'meat', and æ”µ(æ”´ pÅ«) 'beat'. î¿  = æ— = éº» is hemp fibers. Whatever you æ”µ beat, either è‚‰ meat or éº» hemp, it will fall apart eventually.
	"A cognate word is æ’’ sÇ sprinkle" --Karlgren.
	The left side is NOT æ˜” xÄ«, which has æ—¥ rather than æœˆ.

æ­¥ [bÃ¹] step; è¿›æ­¥ jÃ¬nbÃ¹ progress; æ•£æ­¥ sÃ nbÃ¹ go for a walk
The top is æ­¢ (zhÇ) and the bottom was originally æ­¢ backwards.
	"Picture of one right-foot and one left foot" --Karlgren.
	The bottom has only three strokes, unlike å°‘ shÇo which has four.

å²¸ [Ã n] shore
From å±± (shÄn) 'mountain', å‚ 'cliff' and å¹² gÄn phonetic.
	An old form was å±µ.

è…»(Fè†©) [nÃ¬] greasy, oily; smooth; (è…»çƒ¦ nÃ¬fan) disgusted, fed up
From æœˆ(è‚‰ rÃ²u) 'flesh' and è´°(è²³) Ã¨r (two) phonetic.

ç‚‰(Fçˆ) [lÃº] (ç‚‰å­ lÃºzi) stove, oven, furnace
Once written ç›§; then ç›§ was borrowed for a surname LÃº, and ç« (huÇ’) 'fire' was added to make çˆ. The simple form ç‚‰ has æˆ· (hÃ¹) in place of ç›§ (NOT å¢ lÃº as might be expected).

å§‘ [gÅ«] å§‘å¨˜ aunt
From å¥³ (nÇš) 'woman' and å¤ gÇ” phonetic.

æ—¢ [jÃ¬] since; already; æ—¢ç„¶ jÃ¬rÃ¡n since, now that
The left side î¿ is from the bottom of é£Ÿ (shÃ­) 'eat'; it depicts a pot of food. The right side æ—¡ is a person facing away from the food, already having eaten. Hence 'already'. Compare å³ jÃ­ 'immediately', where the person is just about to eat, and é„‰(ä¹¡) xiÄng 'countryside' where two folks are eating together.
	The right side was later re-interpreted as æ—¡ jÃ¬ 'belch' (phonetic), which is what you do after eating.
	A variant form is æ—£.

è¶Ÿ [tÃ ng] (measure word) trip; row  [tÄng] ( = è¹š)
From èµ° (zÇ’u) 'walk' and å°š shÃ ng phonetic.

ç¤¾ [shÃ¨] (ç¤¾ä¼š shÃ¨huÃ¬) society
From ç¤»(ç¤º shÃ¬) 'altar' and åœŸ (tÇ”) 'earth'.
	"Altar to the spirits of the land; sacrifice to the spirits of the land; tutelary deity, village, society -- the ç¤º religious rites for åœŸ the land" --Karlgren.

è®¢(Fè¨‚) [dÃ¬ng] conclude (cf å®š)
From è® (è¨€ yÃ¡n) 'words' and ä¸ dÄ«ng phonetic.

çº¿(Fç·š) [xiÃ n] line, thread; å…‰çº¿ light ray; ç”µçº¿ wire
From çºŸ(ç³¸ sÄ«) 'silk thread' and æˆ‹(æˆ”) jiÄn or æ³‰ quÃ¡n phonetic.
	The form ç¶« is sometimes regarded as the standard full form and ç·š as a variant, but the Taiwan Big5 character set only includes ç·š, not ç¶«. ShuÅwÃ©n treats ç¶« as the main form and ç·š as a å¤æ–‡.)

é‡ [liÃ ng] amount; é‡è¯ classifier  [liÃ¡ng] measure
é‡ is composed of æ—¥ (rÃ¬) 'sun' over ä¸€ (yÄ«) 'one' over é‡Œ (lÇ) 'half kilometer'. The distance to the æ—¥ sun has been é‡ measured: it is exactly ä¸€ one é‡Œ li away. This is astronomically and etymologically absurd, but it might help you remember the character.
	The true explanation is obscure. The bottom is from é‡ zhÃ²ng 'heavy', which is a picture of a weighing machine. The top æ—¥ might be an object being weighed, or a contraction of è‰¯ liÃ¡ng phonetic.
	In dictionaries you will often see the character é‡ used as an abbreviation for é‡è¯ liÃ ngcÃ­ measure word, or classifier, an important part of speech in Chinese (like ä¸ª, æ, åŒ¹, etc).

é¡º(Fé †) [shÃ¹n] along, in the same direction as; obey; suitable
From å· chuÄn ('river') phonetic and é¡µ(é  yÃ¨) 'head'.

å±€ [jÃº] department; situation; é‚®å±€ yÃ³ujÃº post office
From å°¸ 'body' and å¥ jÃ¹ phonetic. Note that å¥ loses its first stroke when it becomes part of å±€.

æŠ¤(Fè­·) [hÃ¹] (ä¿æŠ¤ bÇohÃ¹) guard, protect; æŠ¤å£« hÃ¹shi nurse
From æ‰Œ(æ‰‹ shÇ’u) 'hand' and æˆ· hÃ¹ ('door') phonetic.
	The full form è­· is completely different: from è¨€ (yÃ¡n) 'words' and è’¦ huÃ² phonetic.

æ‹œ [bÃ i] honor, worship; ç¤¼æ‹œ lÇbÃ i week   [bÃ¡i] æ‹œæ‹œ bye-bye

è¯(Fè­‰) [zhÃ¨ng] prove; å›¾ä¹¦è¯ library card
From è® (è¨€ yÃ¡n) 'words' and æ­£ zhÃ¨ng 'correct'.
	The full form è­‰ is composed of è¨€ and ç™» dÄ“ng phonetic. Another character è¨¼ was often used in place of è­‰; according to Karlgren è¨¼ zhÃ¨ng 'remonstrate' was etymologically the same word as æ­£ and æ”¿. (è¯´æ–‡: "è¨¼, è««ä¹Ÿã€‚")

é¢†(Fé ˜) [lÇng] to lead; collar; é¢†å¯¼, é¢†è¢– leader; æœ¬é¢† ability

å€ [zhÇ] åœ°å€ dÃ¬zhÇ address
From åœŸ (tÇ”) 'ground' and æ­¢ zhÇ (picture of a foot).

å¢¨ [mÃ²] (å¢¨æ°´ mÃ²shuÇ) ink; å¢¨å­ MÃ²zÇ (a philosopher)
