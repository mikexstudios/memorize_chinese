Lesson 5 Words compiled by Michael Huynh

é€‰(Fé¸) [xuÇn] (é€‰æ‹© xuÇnzÃ©) choose, select; é€‰ä¸¾ xuÇnjÇ” election
From (full form:) å·½ xÃ¹n (The Gentle) or (simple form:) å…ˆ xiÄn (first) phonetic, and è¾¶(è¾µ chuÃ²) 'go'.

ä¸“(Få°ˆ) [zhuÄn] (ä¸“é—¨) special; (ä¸“å®¶) expert; ä¸“æ”¿ dictatorship
î¾¸ depicts a yoked ç‰› (niÃº) ox. A å¯¸ (cÃ¹n) hand was added, leading the ox. Dedication to a task.

ä¸š(Fæ¥­) [yÃ¨] å•†ä¸š commerce; å·¥ä¸š industry; ä½œä¸š homework
"A æœ¨ tree crowded with its ä¸µ foliage. The moral foliage, the deeds of a man, the affairs upon which he exerts his activity, and what he acquires by his doings, viz. merits, goods, titles, etc." --Wieger.
	Only the highest leaves are left in the simple form ä¸š.
	Some scholars believe ä¸š(æ¥­) to have been a picture of a musical instrument, not a plant (Henshall).
	The fact that å¶(è‘‰) yÃ¨ 'leaf' sounds the same seems to be coincidental, since the ancient pronunciations had different initial consonants (*ng- vs. *d-). The Cantonese pronunciations are also different: ä¸š yihp; å¶ hihp.

äºš(Fäº) [yÃ ] inferior, second; äºšæ´² YÃ zhÅu Asia
"Picture of a humpback." --Karlgren.
	"A å·¥ work deformed; ugly, as a hunchback. The vertical line is doubled, to show a deformation in different directions. The meaning SECOND, derived from äºŒ, is jiÇjiÃ¨." --Wieger.
	Cognate with æ¶ Ã¨, wÃ¹.
	The meaning "Asia" is from a phonetic loan: äºšç»†äºš YÃ xÃ¬yÃ .

å² [shÇ] (å†å² lÃ¬shÇ) history; (surname)
"Hand holding a style (pen) and writing on a å›— wooden block" --Karlgren.
	It isn't clear what the hand was originally holding; it looked like ä¸­ (zhÅng) 'middle' in the oldest characters. It appears that å² shÇ 'history', äº‹ shÃ¬ 'event', and å lÃ¬ 'officer', and the right side of ä½¿ shÇ 'make' were all originally the same: a hand holding some unknown object. These words are believed to be cognates.

ç»Ÿ(Fçµ±) [tÇ’ng] ç³»ç»Ÿ system; ç»Ÿæ²» dominate; ç»Ÿä¸€ unify
From çºŸ(ç³¸ sÄ«) 'thread' and å…… chÅng phonetic.

è®¡(Fè¨ˆ) [jÃ¬] (è®¡ç®—) count, calculate; ç»Ÿè®¡ statistics
From è® (è¨€ yÃ¡n) 'words' and å (shÃ­) 'ten'.
	The å ten è¨€ words used for counting are ä¸€äºŒä¸‰å››äº”å…­ä¸ƒå…«ä¹å.

å— [shÃ²u] receive; æ¥å— jiÄ“shÃ²u accept; éš¾å— nÃ¡nshÃ²u unhappy
A çˆ« hand reaching down, giving, and a åˆ(î¿°) hand reaching up, receiving a å†– thing. In some ancient forms the å†– thing was a èˆŸ boat. Possibly the hands are unloading (receiving) goods from the boat. According to ZhÅu FÇgÄo the thing was a tray before it was a boat, and èˆŸ zhÅu was substituted as a phonetic component to suggest the sound shÃ²u.
	Compare æˆ shÃ²u 'give, award', which is etymologically the same word as å— shÃ²u.
	Also compare æ”¶ shÅu 'receive' which is similar in meaning and sound (shÅu versus shÃ²u), but used differently from å— shÃ²u.

å [fÇn] turn over; (åå¯¹ fÇnduÃ¬) oppose; åæ˜  fÇnyÃ¬ng reflect  [bÇn] åå proper
í¡€í²† is a line representing the motion of the î¿°(åˆ yÃ²u) hand turning over, or í¡€í²† is something that the hand is turning over.

å¤ [fÃ¹] (Få¾©) ï€Ÿ; æ¢å¤ recover; (Fè¤‡) å¤æ‚ complex; (Fè¦†) cover
Originally from ç• fÃº phonetic (now î¿¶ plus æ—¥) and å¤‚ a foot pointing downwards.
	"To go back -- the upper part is shown by the seal to be a variant of ç•" --Karlgren.

æŒ‡ [zhÇ] finger; point; æŒ‡å¤´ zhÇtou finger; æŒ‡ç”² zhÇjia nail
From æ‰Œ(æ‰‹ shÇ’u) 'hand' and æ—¨ zhÇ phonetic.

å¯¼(Få°) [dÇo] lead; é¢†å¯¼ lÇngdÇo leader
The full form å° is é“ dÃ o 'path' over å¯¸ (cÃ¹n) 'hand'. Karlgren says å° is cognate to é“.
	The simple form å¯¼ has å·³ in place of é“. Notice the difference between å¯¼(å°) dÇo and å¼‚(ç•°) yÃ¬.

æˆ [shÃ²u] award, give; teach; æ•™æˆ jiÃ oshÃ²u professor
æˆ shÃ²u 'give' is etymologically the same word as å— shÃ²u 'receive', the character being enlarged by æ‰Œ(æ‰‹ shÇ’u) 'hand' (å— already has two hands in it: çˆ« and åˆ). Giving and receiving are the same event construed two different ways.

è®¨(Fè¨) [tÇo] (è®¨è®º tÇolÃ¹n) discuss; è®¨åŒ tÇoyÃ n digusting
From è® (è¨€ yÃ¡n) 'words' and å¯¸ (cÃ¹n) 'inch'.

èŠ [liÃ¡o] just; slightly; æ— èŠ wÃºliÃ¡o bored; silly; èŠå¤©å„¿ chat
From è€³ (Ä›r) 'ear' and å¯ mÇo (fourth) phonetic.
	Compare ç•™ liÃº, æŸ³ liÇ”, etc.

è‚¯ [kÄ›n] be willing to; consent; è‚¯å®š kÄ›ndÃ¬ng definitely
From æ­¢ (zhÇ) 'stop' over æœˆ(è‚‰ rÃ²u) 'flesh'.
	Don't æ­¢ stop, the è‚‰ flesh is willing.
	In reality, the top used to be å† 'skeleton':
	"The æœˆ flesh, by opposition to the å† skeleton. The top of å† was already missing in the å°ç¯† xiÇozhuÃ n writing. The modern scribes replaced it by a æ­¢ , which is a nonsense, kÄ›n having nothing in common with æ­¢; è‘—éª¨è‚‰ä¹Ÿã€‚ä»è‚‰, ä»å†çœ, ä¼šè®®ã€‚ä»Šä¿—å­—è¯¯ä½œè‚¯ã€‚The flesh being soft and flexible relatively to the bones that are tough and rigid, hence the derived meanings, to model one's self, to yield, to follow, to be easy tempered, to be inclined, prone to" --Wieger.

å®š [dÃ¬ng] fix; ä¸€å®š yÃ­dÃ¬ng definite; å†³å®š juÃ©dÃ¬ng decide
From å®€ (miÃ¡n) 'roof' and î¿™(æ­£) zhÃ¨ng phonetic.
	Compare æ˜¯ shÃ¬ and èµ° zÇ’u.

è‡³ [zhÃ¬] to, until; ç”šè‡³ shÃ¨nzhÃ¬ even; è‡³å°‘ zhÃ¬shÇo at least
"Picture of an arrow that has reached its target" --Lindqvist.

æ¯•(Fç•¢) [bÃ¬] æ¯•ä¸š bÃ¬yÃ¨ graduate; æ¯•ç«Ÿ bÃ¬jÃ¬ng after all
Picture of a net for catching birds. The full form ç•¢ has ç”° tiÃ¡n 'field' at the top. In the simple form æ¯• the top is æ¯” bÇ phonetic.
	Compare ç¦» lÃ­, which originally showed the same net with a bird.
	Don't confuse æ¯•(ç•¢) bÃ¬ with å(è¯) huÃ¡.

ç³» [xÃ¬] n. â‘ system; series; family â‘¡department (in a college); faculty
"The original character had çˆª hand above, now badly contracted, and ç³¸ silk thread" --Karlgren.
	Tie together, connect. One full form ä¿‚ has äº» added on the left side. Another full form ç¹« has æ¯„(å‡») jÄ« phonetic on top instead of the ä¸¿ stroke. Only ç³» occurs among simple form characters.

ç®— [suÃ n] (è®¡ç®— jÃ¬suÃ n) compute; ç®—äº† forget it, never mind
"å»¾(î¿Ÿ) two hands working with ç›® an abacus (picture) of ç«¹ bamboo"
 --Karlgren.
	The abacus was not actually invented as long ago as the character ç®—, but the hands are probably manipulating bamboo counting-sticks.
	An old variant form of ç®— was ç¤º doubled; see è’œ suÃ n 'garlic'.

ç ” [yÃ¡n] grind; (ç ”ç©¶ yÃ¡njiÅ«) study
From çŸ³ (shÃ­) 'stone' and å¼€(å¹µ) qiÄn phonetic. The right side is now written like å¼€ kÄi 'open', but it was a originally a character å¹µ qiÄn 'level', composed of å¹² (gÄn) doubled. å¹µ is obsolete. In ç ” yÃ¡n the horizontal strokes were joined to look like å¼€ kÄi. The lower part of å¹¶ bÃ¬ng has the same origin.

ç©¶ [jiÅ«] ç ”ç©¶ yÃ¡njiÅ« study, research; ç©¶ç«Ÿ after all
From ç©´ (xuÃ©) 'hole' and ä¹ jiÇ” phonetic.

é™¢ [yuÃ n] courtyard; å­¦é™¢ college; åŒ»é™¢ hospital; æ³•é™¢ court
From é˜(é˜œ fÃ¹) 'hill' and å®Œ wÃ¡n phonetic.

ç®¡ [guÇn] tube; (ç®¡ç† guÇnlÇ) manage; ä¸ç®¡ bÃ¹guÇn no matter
From ç«¹ (zhÃº) 'bamboo' and å®˜ guÄn ('official') phonetic.

ç§‘ [kÄ“] department; ç§‘å­¦ kÄ“xuÃ© science; å¤–ç§‘ wÃ ikÄ“ surgery
From ç¦¾ hÃ© ('grain') phonetic and æ–— (dÇ’u) 'measure'. æ–— is a picture of a measuring cup. Science has to do with measuring things.

èµš(Fè³º) [zhuÃ n] gain, profit    [zuÃ n] cheat
From è´(è² bÃ¨i) 'money' and å…¼ jiÄn (double) phonetic.

"Two ç¦¾ straws joined in the î¿­ hand: gather, put together" --Karlgren(1923).
	"Two arrows grasped in one hand" --Karlgren(1940).
	Compare ç§‰ bÇng 'grasp'.

æ„¿(Fé¡˜) [yuÃ n] wish
From åŸ yuÃ¡n phonetic and å¿ƒ (xÄ«n) 'heart'. The full form é¡˜ is from åŸ yuÃ¡n and é  (yÃ¨) 'head'.

å½“ [dÄng] (Fç•¶) serve as; (Få™¹) ding-dong  [dÃ ng] (Fç•¶) (å½“ä½œ) regard as  [dÇng] (Fç•¶)
From å°š shÃ ng phonetic and ç”° tiÃ¡n 'field'.
	"The fundamental sense is 'value'" --Karlgren.
	A ç”° field is valuable property. å°š 'superior' also suggests the meaning. The simple form å½“ is âºŒ over å½. (å½“ is also the Japanese form).

æ•´ [zhÄ›ng] (æ•´ä¸ª) whole; è°ƒæ•´ tiÃ¡ozhÄ›ng adjust; æ•´é½ zhÄ›ngqÃ­ neat
From æ•• (chÃ¬) 'imperial command' over æ­£ zhÃ¨ng 'straight, correct'. æ•´ and æ­£ are cognate.
	"(Make straight:) regulate, arrange, adjust, repair; complete, whole -- the signific is æ•• command; certain commentators, however, take the parts separately: 'to æŸ bind and æ”µ beat a little, so as to make it æ­£ straight'" --Karlgren.

ç—… [bÃ¬ng] sick; æ¯›ç—… mÃ¡obing malfunction
From ç–’ (nÃ¬) 'sick' (depicting a person lying in bed) and ä¸™ bÇng phonetic.

å“² [zhÃ©] å“²å­¦ zhÃ©xuÃ© philosophy
From æŠ˜ zhÃ© phonetic (break, fold, change direction) over å£ (kÇ’u) 'mouth'.

ç”³ [shÄ“n] explain; 9th åœ°æ”¯ Earthly Branch
"Two hands stretching something ä¸¨ long" --Karlgren.
	Now 'stretch' is written ä¼¸ shÄ“n, with äº» (rÃ©n) 'person' added. The meaning 'explain' may have been extended from the meaning 'stretch'.

è™‘(Fæ…®) [lÇœ] (è€ƒè™‘ kÇolÇœ) consider; å¿§è™‘ yÅulÇœ worry about
From è™ hÇ” ('tiger') phonetic and å¿ƒ (xÄ«n) 'heart'. The full form æ…® contains æ€ (sÄ«) 'thought' rather than just å¿ƒ.
	If è™ hÇ” is phonetic in è™‘ lÇœ, then "there must have been an Archaic initial guttural + l" says Karlgren. (In other words, the very old pronunciation of è™ hÇ” might have been something like *klu or *hlu.)
	Compare è™š xÅ« 'void', in which è™ hÇ” is definitely phonetic.

éªŒ(Fé©—) [yÃ n] (ç»éªŒ jÄ«ngyÃ n) experience
From é©¬(é¦¬ mÇ) 'horse' and ä½¥(åƒ‰) qiÄn phonetic.

å±¥ [lÇš] shoes; ï€ˆ Treading
"A shoe; to tread, walk -- the seal contains å°¸ body, å½³ and å¤‚ to walk, and above the latter a picture of a shoe of the same type as èˆŸ" --Karlgren.
	So, according to Karlgren, å±¥ lÇš is unrelated to å¤(å¾©) fÃ¹.

å† [lÃ¬] (Fæ­·) å†å² lÃ¬shÇ history; ç»å† experience; (Fæ›†) æ—¥å†
There are several full forms, the most standard, æ­·, being å‚ over ç§ over æ­¢. The only signific part is æ­¢ (zhÇ), representing a foot, for the meaning 'to go through'. A variant æ›† has æ—¥ (rÃ¬) 'day' (meaning 'time') in place of æ­¢. The remainder (å‚ over ç§) is an obsolete character used in æ­· as a phonetic component.
	The simple form å† is å‚ over åŠ› lÃ¬ phonetic.

å’± [zÃ¡n] (å’±ä»¬ zÃ¡nmen) we     [zan] (from æ—©æ™š zÇowÇn)
From å£ (kÇ’u) 'mouth' and è‡ª (zÃ¬) 'self'.
	"We two; I, we -- one's è‡ª own å£ appellation" --Karlgren.

è®®(Fè­°) [yÃ¬] (è®®è®º yÃ¬lÃ¹n) discuss; ä¼šè®® conference; å»ºè®® suggest
From è® (è¨€ yÃ¡n) 'words' and ä¹‰(ç¾©) yÃ¬ 'justice'.
	è®® is cognate with ä¹‰.
	"(Discuss what is right:) deliberate upon, criticise" --Karlgren.
