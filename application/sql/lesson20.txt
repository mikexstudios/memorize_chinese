From æ°µ(æ°´ shuÇ) 'water' and äº(äº) yÃº (lose, treat unfairly, surname) phonetic.
	äº here is derived from äº yÃº, phonetic, rather than äº(è™§) kuÄ«, even though it looks like äº kuÄ« in the modern writing. A variant form is æ±™.

æŸ“ [rÇn] to dye; catch (disease); æŸ“æ–™ dye; æ±¡æŸ“ pollution
From æ°µ(æ°´ shuÇ) 'water', ä¹ (jiÇ”) 'nine', and æœ¨ (mÃ¹) 'tree'.
	"To dye; imbue with, infect -- the commentator says: ä¹ nine dippings into a æ°´ decoction of a special kind of æœ¨ tree" --Karlgren.

è”(Fè¯) [liÃ¡n] unite, join; è”ç³» liÃ¡nxÃ¬ contact
From è€³ (Ä›r) 'ear' and å…³(í¡ˆí·‡) (guan, shut). The similarity to å…³(í¡ˆí·‡é—œ) guÄn is accidental.

	Compare æµ liÃº 'flow'.

ç‚‰(Fçˆ) [lÃº] (ç‚‰å­ lÃºzi) stove, oven, furnace
Once written ç›§; then ç›§ was borrowed for a surname LÃº, and ç« (huÇ’) 'fire' was added to make çˆ. The simple form ç‚‰ has æˆ· (hÃ¹) in place of ç›§ (NOT å¢ lÃº as might be expected).

éœ€ [xÅ«] (éœ€è¦ xÅ«yÃ o) need; ï€…; å¿…éœ€ bÃ¬xÅ« essential
From é›¨ yÇ” ('rain') phonetic and è€Œ (Ã©r) which depicts a beard.
	It's easy to confuse éœ€ xÅ« 'need' with é¡» xÅ« 'must' (as in å¿…é¡» bÃ¬xÅ«). They are etymologically the same word, according to Karlgren(1923). To be precise, éœ€ and é¡» are both used to write xÅ« 'need/must', but in different compounds; they are generally not interchangeable. Karlgren says éœ€ probably was originally used for the word é¡»(é¬š) xÅ« 'beard' (as in èƒ¡é¡» hÃºxÅ«), which explains why it contains è€Œ.

ä¿± [jÃ¹] all; ä¿±ä¹éƒ¨ jÃ¹lÃ¨bÃ¹ club  [jÅ«] together. adv. completely; entirely
From äº»(äºº rÃ©n) 'person' and å…· jÃ¹ phonetic.

ç›Š [yÃ¬] (åˆ©ç›Š lÃ¬yÃ¬) advantage, profit; ï€œ Increase â‘¢increase
From æ°´ (shuÇ) 'water' turned sideways (it looks just like â˜µ KÇn in the seal character), over çš¿ (mÇn) 'dish'.
	"It represents a çš¿ vase, so full of æ°´ water, that it overflows. This circumstance is represented by the fact that æ°´ is over the vase and is bent down, thus expressing its overflowing. By extension, addition, profit, excess, overplus." --Wieger.

å‰§(FåŠ‡) [jÃ¹] drama, play, opera; å‰§çƒˆ jÃ¹liÃ¨ severe; acute; severe; intense
