Lesson 2 Words Compiled by Michael Huynh

屋 [wū] (屋子 wūzi) room; (房屋 fángwū) building; 屋顶 roof
From 尸 (shī) 'body' and 至 (zhì) 'until'.
	"Place where 尸 a man being 至 arrived, takes rest." --Wieger.
	"Where you 至 come and 尸 lie or sit down, cf 处." --Karlgren.
	Compare 室 shì 'room'.

熟 [shú] cooked, ripe, familiar; 熟悉 shúxī know well  [shóu]
Originally written 孰, which is 丸() a hand offering up a 享 (xiǎng) 'feast'. 灬(火 huǒ) 'fire' was added later. Compare 热(熱) rè 'hot'.
	The pronunciation shóu commonly occurs with the same meanings and uses as shú.

悉 [xī] 熟悉 shúxī know well, be familiar with
From 釆 (biàn) 'discern' and 心 (xīn) 'heart'. Notice that the top 釆 (biàn) is NOT the same as 采 cǎi (which is 爫 over 木).
	"A 釆 discerning 心 (heart:) intelligence" --Karlgren.
	悉 is phonetic in 蟋 as in 蟋蟀 xīshuài 'cricket'.

窗 [chuāng] (窗户 chuānghu, 窗口) window; 窗帘 curtain
From 穴 (xué) 'hole' over 囱 (烟囱 yāncōng 'chimney'), picture of a window.

户(F戶) [hù] door; household; 窗户 chuānghù window
Picture of a door, one side of 门(門 mén).

摆(F擺) [bǎi] put, arrange; sway, wave; 摇摆舞 rock 'n' roll
From 扌(手 shǒu) 'hand' and 罢(罷) bà phonetic.

被 [bèi] quilt; by; (indicates passive voice)   [pī]
From 衤(衣 yī) 'clothing' and 皮 pí ('skin') phonetic.

毯 [tǎn] (毯子 tǎnzi) blanket; (地毯 dìtǎn) carpet, rug
From 毛 'hair' and 炎 yán phonetic.

柜 [guì] (F櫃) (柜子) cabinet; 柜台 counter; 掌柜 shopkeeper  [jǔ]
Originally written 匱, from 匚 (fāng) (picture of a cabinet), and 貴 guì phonetic. 木 (mù) 'wood' was added, producing the full form 櫃.
	In the simple form 柜, 匱 has been replaced by 巨 (jù). (Actually the character 柜 existed previously as an old form of 榉 jǔ.)

挂(F掛) [guà] hang, put up
From 扌(手 shǒu) 'hand' and 圭 guī or 卦 guà phonetic.
	Only the simple form 挂 appears in 说文解字. The complex form 掛 was listed in the dictionary 广韵 (1011 A.D.) as a "popular form" (俗字) of 挂. 掛 is now more common in Taiwan.

调(F調) [diào] shift; tone  [tiáo] adjust
From 讠(言 yán) 'words' and 周 zhōu phonetic.

栋(F棟) [dòng] ridgepole, m. (for houses)
From 木 (mù) 'tree' and 东(東) dōng phonetic.

设(F設) [shè] set up; 建设 construct; 设计 design; 设备 equipment
From 讠(言 yán) 'words' and 殳 (shū) 'beat'.
	"To 言 command and 殳 beat" --Karlgren.
	Compare 投 tóu 'throw'.

备(F備) [bèi] (准备) get ready, prepare; 设备 equipment
The explanation of 备 is obscure. There have been numerous different forms, including the full form 備 and the simple form 备.
	Mnemonic for 备: 夂 (zhǐ) walk slowly around a 田 (tián) field, preparing equipment?

旧(F舊) [jiù] old (not new) (cf 老 old, not young; 新 new)
The full form 舊 is 艹 over 隹 over 臼. The original meaning was 'owl': a 隹 (zhuī) bird with 艹 feather-horns (really 雈, slightly different on top from 萑). 臼 jiù ('mortar') is phonetic. The character was borrowed for the word jiù 'old' which happened to sound the same.
	臼 jiù is difficult to write well in a hurry, so in handwriting it can come out like 丨 plus 日. Then for the simple form 旧, 艹 and 隹 were dropped altogether from 舊. (臼 jiù meaning 'mortar' retains its full form.)

厕(F廁) [cè] 厕所 cèsuǒ toilet  [si] 茅厕 máosi latrine
From 厂 (chǎng) or 广 (guǎng) 'shack' and 则(則) zé phonetic.
	A variant form is 厠.

浴 [yù] 沐浴 mùyù take a bath; 浴室 yùshì bath/shower room
From 氵(水 shuǐ) 'water' and 谷 gǔ phonetic.

恐 [kǒng] (恐怕 kǒngpà) I'm afraid; 恐怖 kǒngbù terror
From 巩 gǒng phonetic and 心 (xīn) 'heart'.

楼(F樓) [lóu] story, building; 大楼 mansion; 楼梯 lóutī stairs
From 木 (mù) 'wood' and 娄(婁) lóu phonetic.

商 [shāng] discuss; business
"It is formed by combination and fusion of 言 (yán) and 内 (nèi). The 口 mouth at the bottom of the compound, belongs to 言... To 言 express one's 内 interior feelings" --Wieger.
	"The seal has 言 and 内 interlaced" --Karlgren.
	The oldest oracle-bone forms of 商 did not have 口 (kǒu) at the bottom; the explanation of the original shape remains unclear.

品 [pǐn] (产品 chǎnpǐn) product; 商品 shāngpǐn merchandise
"Symbol for objects piled up, arranged in groups, classified" --Karlgren.

具 [jù] 工具 tool; 具有 possess; 具体 concrete; 玩具 toy
"廾() two hands handling 目 something which the commentators say is 貝 money abbreviated but which may have been simply a picture of some implement" --Karlgren.
	Judging from the ancient bronze character, the top really was 貝 bèi (cowrie:) money, suggesting the meaning 'possess' rather than 'tool'.
	"A cowrie shell and two hands: to acquire, to prepare and tool, implement" --Lindqvist.
	Compare 得 dé 'obtain', which was originally 寸 one hand and 貝 money.

层(F層) [céng] layer, level, storey
The full form 層 is 尸 over 曾 cēng phonetic.
	The simple form 层 is 尸 over 云 (yún) 'cloud'.

烘 [hōng] dry, toast; to warm; 热烘烘 very warm
From 火 (huǒ) 'fire' and 共 gòng.

静(F靜) [jìng] still, quiet; 静电 static electricity
Strangely, 青 qīng ('green') and 争(爭) zhèng ('struggle') both seem to be phonetic in 静 jìng. Compare the variant forms 靖 and 竫, both with 立 (lì) 'stand' and either 青 or 爭 as phonetic. 靖 is still used in the word 绥靖 suíjìng 'pacify', whereas 竫 is obsolete.

般 [bān] sort, kind; 一般 yìbān ordinary  [pán] happy  [bō] 般若
From 舟 (zhōu) 'boat' and 殳 (shū) 'beat'.
	To 殳 (beat:) propel a 舟 boat --> distribute --> category. The old meaning 'transport' is now 搬 bān, with 扌(手 shǒu) 'hand' added. Don't confuse with 船 chuán 'boat', which has 叴 not 殳.

猜 [cāi] guess; 猜想 cāixiǎng suppose
From 犭(犬 quǎn) 'dog' and 青 (qīng) 'green'.
	"A 青 (green, greyish, etc.:) curiously colored 犭 dog?" --Karlgren.

胃 [wèi] stomach; 胃口 wèikǒu appetite
From 田 (tián 'field') over 月(肉 ròu) 'flesh'.
	"Above, a picture of a stomach with contents; below, 肉" --Karlgren.

急 [jí] urgent; 着急 zháojí anxious; 急忙 jímáng in a hurry
The top 刍 was originally 及 jí, which is a 又 hand grabbing a 人 person. 急 and 及 are cognate; 急 is enlarged by 心 (xīn) 'heart'. In 急, the 人 person is written ⺈, and the 又 hand is written 彐, but the similarity to 刍(芻) chú 'hay' is accidental. The 急 in 隐(隱) yǐn and 稳(穩) wěn has yet another origin.

约(F約) [yuē] approximately; arrange; appointment   [yāo] weigh
From 纟(糸 sī) 'thread' and 勺 sháo ('spoon') phonetic.
	"To bind, bind oneself, engage, agreement, compact; restrain, moderate; 

翰 [hàn] writing brush; writing
From 倝(乾) qián phonetic and 羽 (yǔ) 'feathers'.
